      Lord Macaulay&rsquo;s Critical, Historical, and Miscellaneous Essays, contains
      all the articles published with the author&rsquo;s correction and revision (3
      vols., London: Longman, Green, &amp; Co.) during his lifetime, and all the
      articles published by his friends (2 vols., London: Longman, Green &amp;
      Co.) since his death. An Appendix contains several essays attributed to
      Lord Macaulay, and unquestionably his, not found in any other edition of
      his miscellaneous writings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this edition the Essays have been arranged in chronological order, so
      that their perusal affords, so to speak, a complete biographical
      portraiture of the brilliant author&rsquo;s mind. No other edition possesses the
      same advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very full Index has been especially prepared for this edition,&mdash;without
      which the vast stores of historical learning and pertinent anecdote
      contained in the Essays can be referred to only by the fortunate man who
      possesses a memory as great as that of Macaulay himself. In this respect
      it is superior to the English editions, and wholly unlike any other
      American edition.
    </p>
    <p>
      This edition also contains the pure text of Macaulay&rsquo;s Essays. The exact
      punctuation, orthography, etc. of the English editions have been followed.

      historian as he appeared in the latter years of his life.

    <p>
      The biographical and critical Introduction is from the well-known pen of
      Mr. E. P. Whipple, who is fully entitled to speak with authority in regard
      to the most brilliant essayist of the age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The typographical excellence of the publication places it among the best
      that have issued from the &ldquo;Riverside&rdquo; Press. We trust the public will
      appreciate what has long been needed,&mdash;a complete and correct
      edition, in handsome library style, of Lord Macaulay&rsquo;s Essays.

      BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF MACAULAY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he materials for
      the biography of Lord Macaulay are scanty, and the writer of the present
      sketch has been able to glean few facts regarding his career which are not
      generally known. His life was comparatively barren in events, and though
      he rose to conspicuous social, literary, and political station, he had
      neither to struggle nor scramble for advancement. Almost as soon as his
      talents were displayed they were recognized and rewarded, and he attained
      fortune and power without using any means which required the least
      sacrifice, either of the integrity or the pride of his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Babington Macaulay was born at Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, on
      the twenty-fifth of October, 1800. His father, Zachary Macaulay, the son
      of a Scotch Presbyterian clergyman, was one of the worthiest and ablest
      antislavery philanthropists and politicians of his time, distinguished,
      even among such men as Wilberforce, Clarkson, and Stephen, for courage,
      sagacity, integrity, and religious principle. His mother was the daughter
      of Thomas Mills, a bookseller in Bristol, and belonged to the Society of
      Friends. Under her loving care he received his early education, and was
      not sent from home until his thirteenth year, when he was placed in a
      private academy. As a boy, he astonished all who knew him, by the
      brightness and eagerness of his mind, and the extent and variety of his
      acquisitions. Two lately published letters, written by Hannah More to his
      father, afford a pleasing glimpse of him, as he appeared to a shrewd and
      affectionate observer of his early years. She speaks of his &ldquo;great
      superiority of intellect and quickness of passion,&rdquo; at the age of eleven.
      He ought, she thinks, to have competitors, for &ldquo;he is like the prince who
      refused to play with anything but kings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;saw any one bad propensity in him; nothing except
      natural frailty and ambition, inseparable perhaps from such talents and so
      lively an imagination; he appears sincere, veracious, tender-hearted, and
      affectionate.&rdquo; He was a fertile versifier, even at that tender age, but
      she &ldquo;observed with pleasure that though he was quite wild till the
      ebullitions of his muse were discharged, he thought no more of them
      afterwards than the ostrich is said to do of her eggs after she has laid
      them.&rdquo; In another letter, written about two years afterwards, when the
      bright lad was nearly fourteen, she says, &ldquo;the quantity of reading Tom has
      poured in, and the quantity of writing he has poured out, is astonishing.&rdquo;
       Poetry continued to be his passion, but his venerable friend still
      testifies to his promising habit of throwing his verses away as soon as he
      had read them to her. &ldquo;We have poetry,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;for breakfast,
      dinner, and supper. He recited all <i>Palestine</i>, while we breakfasted,
      to our pious friend, Mr. Whalley, at my desire, and did it incomparably.&rdquo;
       She refers to his loquacity, but that quality seems not, in her presence,
      to have been connected with dogmatism, for she calls him very docile. At
      that early age he appears to have been sufficiently master of his stores
      of information to play with them, and his wit kept pace with his
      understanding. &ldquo;Several men of sense and learning,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;have been
      struck with the union of gayety and rationality in his conversation.&rdquo;
       Accuracy of expression seems also to have been as striking a trait of the
      boy&rsquo;s mind as volubility of utterance. One fault is mentioned, which was
      probably the result of his absorption in study and composition.
      Incessantly occupied, mentally, he paid but little attention to his
      personal appearance, and in dress was something of a sloven. Neither his
      father nor Hannah More could cure him of this fault, and, up to the time
      he became a peer, this neglect of externals seems to have been a
      characteristic trait. A fellow-pupil at the academy to which he was sent,
      describes him as &ldquo;rather largely-built than otherwise, but not fond of any
      of the ordinary physical sports of boys; with a disproportionately large
      head, slouching or stooping shoulders, and a whitish or pallid complexion;
      incessantly reading or writing, and often reading or repeating poetry in
      his walks with his companions.&rdquo; In October, 1818, the precocious youth
      entered Trinity College, Cambridge, and during the whole period of his
      residence at the University his special studies did not divert him from
      gratifying his thirst for general knowledge, and taste for general
      literature. In 1819 he gained the chancellor&rsquo;s medal for a poem on the
      subject of Pompeii, and in 1821 the same prize for one on Evening. For
      these, and for all compositions of the kind, he afterwards professed to
      feel the utmost scorn. Two years after his second success as a prize poet,
      we find him comparing prize poems to prize sheep. &ldquo;The object,&rdquo; he says,
      &ldquo;of the competitor for the agricultural premium is to produce an animal
      fit, not to be eaten, but to be weighed. The object of the poetical
      candidate is to produce, not a good poem, but a poem of the exact degree
      of frigidity and bombast which may appear to his censors to be correct or
      sublime. In general prize sheep are good for nothing but to make tallow
      candles, and prize poems are good for nothing but to light them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In 1821 he was elected Craven University Scholar; and in 1822 he
      graduated, and received his degree of B. A.; though he did not compete for
      honors, owing, it is said, to his dislike for mathematics. Between this
      period and 1824, when he was elected Fellow of his College, he contributed
      to Knight&rsquo;s Quarterly Magazine the poems and essays, in which, for the
      first time, we detect the leading traits of his intellectual character. He
      possessed the feeling and the faculty of the poet only so far as they are
      necessary for the interpretative and representative requirements of the
      historian. He possessed the understanding of the philosopher only so far
      as it is necessary to throw into relations the vividly conceived facts
      derived from the records of the annalist. He could not create, but he
      could reproduce; he could not vitally combine, but he could logically
      dispose. The fair operation of these mental qualities was disturbed by the
      peculiarities of his disposition. He had boundless self-confidence, which
      had been consciously or unconsciously pampered by friends who admired the
      remarkable brilliancy of his powers. Independence of thought was thus
      early connected with imperiousness of will and petulant disrespect for
      other minds. Having no self-distrust, there was nothing to check the
      positiveness of his judgments. Where more cautious thinkers doubted he
      dogmatized; their probabilities were his certainties; and generally the
      tone of his judgments seemed to imply his inward belief in the maxim of
      the egotist&mdash;&ldquo;difference from me is the measure of absurdity.&rdquo; Lord
      Melbourne afterwards acutely touched upon this foible, when he lazily
      expressed his wish that he &ldquo;was as sure of anything as Tom Macaulay was of
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A portion of this positiveness is perhaps to be referred as much to the
      vividness of his perceptions as to the autocracy of his disposition. All
      that he read he remembered; and his memory, being indissolubly connected
      with his feelings and his imagination, vitalized all that it retained.
      Facts and persons of a past age were not to him hidden in the words which
      pretended to convey them to the mind, but were perceived as actual events
      and living beings. He could recollect because he could realize and
      reproduce. To his mental eye the past was present, and he had the delight
      of the poet in viewing as things what the historian had recorded in words.
      All men are more positive in regard to what they have seen than in regard
      to what they have heard. If what they have seen awakens in them joy and
      enthusiasm, their expression is instinctively dogmatic, especially if they
      come into collision with persons of fainter and colder perceptions, whose
      understandings are sceptical because their sensibilities are dull. Such,
      to some degree, at least, was the dogmatism of Macaulay in his statements
      of facts. In respect to his positiveness in opinion, it may be said that
      his leading opinions were blended with his moral passions, and an
      unmistakable love of truth animates even his fiercest, haughtiest and most
      disdainful treatment of the opinions of opponents. These qualities do not
      of course wholly explain or extenuate the leading defect of his character;
      for behind them, it must be admitted, were the triumphant consciousness of
      personal vigor, the insolent sense of personal superiority, and the
      relentlessness of temper which so often accompanies strength of
      intellectual conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among his contributions to Knight&rsquo;s Quarterly Magazine, the Fragment of a
      Roman Tale and The Athenian Revels, indicate that at college he had
      studied the ancient classics so thoroughly as to gain no little insight
      into Greek and Roman life. Alcibiades, Cæsar, and Catiline, seem as real
      to him as Canning and Wellington. In the papers on Mitford&rsquo;s History of
      Greece and The Athenian Orators, the same tendency of mind is displayed in
      a critical direction. His intellect penetrates to the realities of the
      society and the individuals he assumes to judge, and the independence,
      originality, and decision of his thinking, correspond to the clearness of
      his perceptions. The Conversation between Cowley and Milton is an example
      of the same sympathetic historic imagination exercised in the discussion
      of great historical questions, yet angrily debated; and in the poem of The
      Battle of Naseby, which purports to be written by Obadiah
      Bind-their-Kings-in-Chains-and-their-Nobles-with- links-of-Iron, Serjeant
      in Ireton&rsquo;s Regiment, an attempt is made to reproduce the fiercest and
      gloomiest religious passions which raged in the breasts of the military
      fanatics among the Puritans. The critical papers on Dante and Petrarch
      exhibit the general characteristic of the writer&rsquo;s later literary
      criticism&mdash;intellectual sympathy superior to rules, but submissive to
      laws; praising warmly, but at the same time, judging keenly; and as
      intolerant of faults as sensitive to merits. The style, both of the
      historical and critical articles, is substantially the style of Macaulay&rsquo;s
      more celebrated essays. There is less energy and freedom of movement, a
      larger use of ornament for the sake of ornament, and a more obvious
      rhetorical artifice in the declamatory passages, but in essential elements
      it is the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the choice of a profession, Macaulay fixed upon the law. He was called
      to the bar in February, 1826, but we hear of no clients; and it is
      doubtful if he ever mastered the details of his profession. Sydney Smith,
      who knew him at this time, said afterwards&mdash;&ldquo;I always prophesied his
      greatness from the first moment I saw him, then a very young and unknown
      man, on the Northern Circuit. There are no limits to his knowledge, on
      small subjects as well as great: he is like a book in breeches.&rdquo; Indeed,
      politics and literature had, from the first, attractions too strong for
      him to resist; and before he entered on the practice of his profession, he
      had, by one article in a review, passed at a bound to a conspicuous place
      among the writers of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been expected, from his family connections, that he would be
      a zealous whig and abolitionist, and his first contribution to the
      Edinburgh Review was on the subject of West India Slavery. It was
      published in the number for January, 1825, and in extent of information,
      force and acuteness of argument, severity of denunciation and sarcasm, and
      fervor and brilliancy of style, it ranks high among the many vigorous
      productions in which Macaulay has recorded his love of freedom and hatred
      of oppression, and exhibited his power of making tyranny ridiculous as
      well as odious. It is curious that this paper, so full of the peculiar
      traits of his character and style, should not have been generally
      recognized as his, after his subsequent articles had familiarized the
      public with his manner of expression. But the date of his first
      contribution to the Review is still commonly considered to be the month of
      August, 1825, when his article on Milton appeared, and at once attained a
      wide popularity. Though when, in 1848, the author collected his Essays, he
      declared that this article &ldquo;hardly contained a paragraph that his matured
      judgment approved,&rdquo; and regretted that he had to leave it unpruned of the
      &ldquo;gaudy and ungraceful ornament&rdquo; with which it was overloaded, its
      popularity has survived its author&rsquo;s harsh judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever were its youthful faults of taste, impertinences of statement,
      and errors of theory, few articles which had ever before appeared in a
      British journal contained so much solid matter in so compact and readable
      a form. If it did not touch the depths of the various topics it so
      confidently discussed, it certainly contained a sufficient number of
      strong and striking thoughts to rescue its brilliancy from the charge of
      superficiality. If the splendor of its rhetoric seemed consciously
      designed for display, this defect applies in great measure to Macaulay&rsquo;s
      rhetoric in general. He popularizes everything. He converts his
      acquirements into accomplishments, and contrives that their show shall
      always equal their substance; but in this essay, as in the dazzling-series
      of essays which succeeded it, a discerning eye can hardly fail to perceive
      beneath the external glitter of the periods, the presence of two qualities
      which are sound and wholesome, namely, broad common sense, and earnest
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the article on Milton, came, in the Edin burgh Review for
      February, 1826, the month in which he was called to the bar, a paper on
      the London University. This was succeeded in March, 1827, by a powerful
      and well-reasoned, but exceedingly bitter and sarcastic antislavery
      article on the Social and Industrial Capacities of Negroes. In June of the
      same year, appeared a paper, evidently written by him, entitled &ldquo;The
      Present Administration,&rdquo; one of the most acrimonious and audacious
      political articles ever published in the Edinburgh Review. Its tone was so
      violent and virulent, and excited so much opposition, that, in the next
      number of the Review, a kind of apology was offered for it under the form
      of explaining its real meaning. Macaulay&rsquo;s real meaning is evident; he
      &ldquo;meant mischief;&rdquo; but in the confused sentences of his apologist hardly
      any meaning is perceptible; and there is something ludicrous in the very
      supposition that the meaning of the clearest and most decisive of writers
      could be mistaken by the public he addressed, and especially by the Tories
      he assailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all editions of his Essays, the admirable article on Machiavelli, one
      of the ablest, most elaborate, and most thoughtful productions of his
      mind, succeeds the article on Milton. It was published in the number of
      the Review for March, 1827. Between 1827 and 1830 appeared the articles on
      Dryden, History, Hallam&rsquo;s Constitutional History, Southey&rsquo;s Colloquies on
      Society, and the three articles on the Utilitarian Theory of Government.
      These proved the capacity of the author to discuss both political and
      literary questions with a boldness, brilliancy, and effectiveness, hardly
      known before in periodical literature. Each essay included an amount of
      digested and generalized knowledge which might easily have been expanded
      into a volume, but which, in its condensed form and sparkling positiveness
      of expression, was all the more efficient. To the Whig party as well as to
      the Whig Review, such an ally had claims which could not be disregarded;
      and in 1830, through the interest of Lord Lansdowne, he was elected a
      member of Parliament for the borough of Caine. His reputation was so well
      established that no idea of patronage entered into this arrangement; and
      he could afterwards boast, with honest pride, that he was as independent
      when he sat in Parliament as the nominee of Lord Lansdowne as when he
      represented the popular constituencies of Leeds and Edinburgh.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an orator, he won a reputation second only to his reputation as a man
      of letters. From all accounts he owed little to his manner of speaking.
      &ldquo;His head,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;was set stiff on his shoulders, and his feet
      were planted immovable on the floor. One hand was fixed behind him across
      his back, and in this rigid attitude, with only a slight movement of his
      right hand, he poured forth, with inconceivable velocity, his sentences.&rdquo;
       His first speech was on the Jews&rsquo; Disabilities Bill, on the fifth of
      April, 1830, followed in December by one on Slavery in the West Indies.
      Both evinced the broad views of the statesman as well as the generous
      warmth of the reformer. He threw himself with characteristic ardor into
      the great struggle for Parliamentary Reform, and his speeches on that
      measure, not only drew forth unbounded applause from his party and
      unwilling admiration from his opponents, but, as read now, after the
      excitement of the occasion has subsided, justify in a great degree the
      enthusiastic praise of those who heard them delivered. Clear and logical
      in arrangement, abundant in precedents and arguments, fearless in tone,
      and animated in movement, they are particularly marked by that fusion of
      intelligence and sensibility which makes passion intelligent and reason
      impassioned. The rush of the declamation is kept carefully within the
      channels of the argument; they convince through the very process by which
      they kindle. Their style is that of splendid and animated conversation;
      though carefully premeditated they have the appearance of being
      spontaneous; and indeed were not, as is commonly supposed, originally
      written out and committed to memory, but thought out and committed to
      memory. Without writing a word, he could prepare an hour&rsquo;s speech, in his
      mind, carefully attending even to the most minute felicities of
      expression, and then deliver it with a rapidity so great that no reporter
      could follow him. The effect on the House of these declaimed disquisitions
      can perhaps be best estimated by quoting a passage from one of his
      political opponents, whose pen, in the heat of faction, was unrestrained
      by any of the proprieties of controversy. In the number of the <i>Noctes
      Ambrosiano</i>, for August, 1831, Macaulay is sneered at as a person whom
      it is the fashion among a small coterie to call &ldquo;the Burke of the age.&rdquo;
       After admitting him to be &ldquo;the cleverest declaimer on the Whig side of the
      House,&rdquo; the account thus proceeds: &ldquo;He is an ugly, cross-made,
      splay-footed, shapeless little dumpling of a fellow, with a featureless
      face, too&mdash;except indeed a good expansive forehead&mdash;sleek,
      puritanical, sandy hair, large glimmering eyes&mdash;and a mouth from ear
      to ear. He has a lisp and burr, moreover, and speaks thickly and huskily
      for several minutes before he gets into the swing of his discourse; but
      after that nothing can be more dazzling than his whole execution. What he
      says is substantially, of course, stuff and nonsense; but it is so
      well-worded, and so volubly and forcibly delivered&mdash;there is such an
      endless string of epigram and antithesis&mdash;such a flashing of epithets&mdash;such
      an accumulation of images&mdash;and the voice is so trumpetlike, and the
      action so grotesquely emphatic, that you might hear a pin drop in the
      House. Even Manners Sutton himself listens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the Reformed Parliament, which met in January, 1833, Macaulay took his
      seat as member for Leeds. He was soon after made Secretary of the Board of
      Control. An economist of his reputation, he did not speak often, but
      reserved himself for those occasions when he could speak with effect.
      Throughout his parliamentary career he showed no inclination to mingle in
      strictly extemporaneous debate, though it seems difficult to conceive that
      a man of such intellectual hardihood as well as intellectual capacity, and
      who in conversation was one of the most fluent and well-informed of human
      beings, lacked the power of thinking on his legs. It is probable that he
      disliked the drudgery of practical political life, and was incapable of
      the continuous party passion which sustains the professional politician.
      An ardent Whig partisan, his partisanship was still roused by the
      principles of his party rather than by its expedients. Literature and the
      philosophy of politics had more fascination for him than the contentions
      of the House of Commons; and he has repeatedly expressed contempt for the
      sophisms and misstatements which, though they will not bear the test of
      careful perusal, pass in the House for facts and arguments when volubly
      delivered in excited debate. Indeed, from 1830 to 1834, the period when he
      was most ambitious for political distinction and preferment, his
      contributions to the Edinburgh Review indicate that while in Parliament he
      gave as much time and thought to literature as he did before he became a
      member. To this period belong his articles on Saddler&rsquo;s Law of Population,
      Bunyan, Byron, Hampden, Lord Burleigh, Mirabeau, Horace Walpole, the elder
      Pitt, Croker&rsquo;s Edition of Boswell&rsquo;s Life of Johnson, the Civil
      Disabilities of the Jews, and the War of the Succession in Spain. Only one
      of his speeches can perhaps compare with the best of these articles In
      range of thought and knowledge, and richness of diction. This was the
      speech which he delivered as Secretary of the Board of Control, in July
      1833, on the new India Bill of the Whig government. Few persons were in
      the house; but Jeffrey, who was in London, wrote to one of his
      correspondents in regard to it:&mdash;&ldquo;Mac is a marvellous person. He made
      the very best speech that has been made this session on India. The
      Speaker, who is a severe judge, says he rather thinks it the best speech
      he ever heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since the time of Burke, no speech in Parliament on the subject of India
      had equalled this in comprehensiveness of thought and knowledge. It
      justified his appointment, made a few months after, of member and legal
      adviser of the Supreme Council of India. Shiel, in a mocking defence of
      Macaulay from the sneers of some person who questioned his abilities, thus
      alluded to this appointment:&mdash;&ldquo;Nonsense, sir! Don&rsquo;t attempt to run
      down Macaulay. He&rsquo;s the cleverest man in Christendom. Didn&rsquo;t he make four
      speeches on the Reform Bill, and get £10,000 a year? Think of that, and be
      dumb!&rdquo; The largeness of the salary, nearly twice that of the President of
      the United States, was probably Macaulay&rsquo;s principal inducement to accept
      the office. His means were small; the gains of the office would in a few
      years make him independent of the world; and though he seemed, in
      accepting it, to abandon the objects of his political ambition, he really
      chose the right course to advance them. Pecuniary independence would
      relieve him from all imputations of being a political adventurer; and he
      had every reason to suppose that he might reach, in England, high
      political office all the more surely if it were understood that the
      emoluments of high political office were not the primary objects of his
      ambition. Apart from such considerations as these, there was something in
      the terms of his appointment eminently calculated to induce him to accept
      it. The special object of his mission was to prepare a new code of Indian
      law; and it is impossible to read his articles on the Utilitarian Theory
      of Government, and Dumont&rsquo;s Recollections of Mirabeau, without perceiving
      that he had studied jurisprudence as a science, and that he considered the
      province of the jurist as even superior to that of the statesman. He went
      to India in 1834, with the feeling that he could prepare a code at once
      practical and just. For four years he labored to solve this problem, and
      the decision of his countrymen appeared to be that, though his solution
      might be just, it was not practical. In the opinion, especially of those
      East Indians whose interests were affected by its justice, it was a &ldquo;Black
      Code.&rdquo; When it was published, on his return from India in 1838, it was
      mercilessly denounced and ridiculed. Alarmists prophesied that, if
      adopted, it would lead to the downfall of the British power in India. Wits
      calculated, with malicious accuracy, the number of guineas which each word
      cost the British people. Between alarmists and wits the whole project fell
      through. There was a general impression that the code would not work, and,
      while its ability was admitted, its practicability was denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his absence in India only two of his articles, the review of
      Mackintosh&rsquo;s History of the Revolution in England in 1688, and the paper
      on Bacon, were published in the Edinburgh Review. The sketch of Bacon&rsquo;s
      life and philosophy is one of the most elaborate, ingenious and brilliant
      products of his mind, but it is full of extravagant overstatements. It is
      biography and criticism in a series of dazzling epigrams; the exaggeration
      of epigram taints both the account of Bacon&rsquo;s life and the estimate of
      Bacon&rsquo;s philosophy; but the charm of the style is so great that, for a
      long time yet to come, it will probably influence the opinion which even
      educated men form of Bacon, though to thoughtful students of the age of
      Elizabeth and James, and to thoughtful students of the history of
      scientific and metaphysical speculation, it may seem as inaccurate in its
      disposition of facts as it is superficial in philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after his return from India, in June, 1838, Macaulay was offered the
      office of Judge Advocate, which he declined. In 1839 the whigs of
      Edinburgh invited him to offer himself as a candidate for the
      representation of that city in Parliament. In a private letter to Adam
      Black, he gave the reasons why, if elected, the position would be
      agreeable to him. &ldquo;I should,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;be able to take part in politics,
      as an independent Member of Parliament, with the weight and authority
      which belongs to a man who speaks in the name of a great and intelligent
      body of constituents. I should, during half the year, be at leisure for
      other pursuits to which I am more inclined, and for which I am perhaps
      better fitted; and I should be able to complete an extensive literary work
      which I have long meditated.&rdquo; He expressed an unwillingness to accept
      office under the government he intended to support, on the ground that he
      disliked the restraints of official life. &ldquo;I love,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;freedom,
      leisure, and letters. Salary is no object to me, for my income, though
      small, is sufficient for a man who has no ostentatious tastes.&rdquo; In regard
      to the expenses of the election, he makes one condition which may surprise
      those American readers, who suppose that none but English politicians who
      are corrupt, pay money to get into Parliament. &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;spend
      more than £500 on the election. If, therefore, there be any probability
      that the candidate will be required to pay more than this, I hope you will
      look round for another person.&rdquo; On the 29th of May, 1839, he made a speech
      to the electors, which for clearness and pungency of statement and
      argument is a model for all orators who are called upon to address a
      popular audience. It was probably this speech which drew forth the
      unintentional compliment from the Edinburgh artisan, that he thought he
      could have made it himself. &ldquo;Ou! it was a wise-like speech, an&rsquo; no that
      defecshunt in airgument; but, eh! man&rdquo;&mdash;with a pause of intense
      disappointment&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; I could ha&rsquo; said the haill o&rsquo; it
      mysel&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some inefficient radical opposition, Macaulay, on the fourth of
      June, was declared duly elected. In September of the same year he was
      induced to accept the office of Secretary at War, in Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s
      administration. In 1841, when Sir Robert Peel came into power, he went
      into opposition, and some of his ablest speeches were made during the five
      years the tories were in office. In 1842, his &ldquo;Lays of Ancient Rome,&rdquo; were
      published, and attained a wide popularity. In 1843 he published a
      collection of his Essays, contributed to the Edinburgh Review, including
      the masterly biographies of Temple, Clive, Hastings, Frederic the Great,
      and Addison, and the papers on Church and State, Ranke&rsquo;s History of the
      Popes, and the Comic Dramatists of the Restoration, written since his
      return from India. In July, 1846, on the return of the Whigs to power, he
      was made Paymaster-General of the Forces. Though his speech and vote on
      the Maynooth College Bill, in 1845, had roused a serious opposition to him
      among the dissenters of Edinburgh, he was still reelected to Parliament,
      though not without a severe struggle, on his acceptance of office. In 1847
      Parliament was dissolved. By this time his offences against the
      theological opinions of his constituents had been increased by his support
      of what they called the system of &ldquo;godless education,&rdquo; which the
      government to which he belonged had patronized. The publicans and spirit
      dealers of the city were also in ill-humor with the Whig government, on
      account of the continuance of &ldquo;undue restrictions in regard to their
      licenses.&rdquo; From the state of the mob that yelled and hissed round the
      hustings, there would have seemed to be no &ldquo;undue restriction&rdquo; on the
      disposal of spirituous liquors to carry the election. Adam Black sums up
      the opposition to Macaulay as consisting of &ldquo;the no-popery men, the
      godless-education men, the crotchety coteries, and the dealers in
      spirits.&rdquo; To all these Macaulay was blunt and unconciliating, strong in
      the feeling that he had excited their hatred by acts which his conscience
      prompted and his reason approved. He would not recant a single expression,
      much less a single opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bray of Exeter Hall,&rdquo; a phrase in his Maynooth speech particularly
      obnoxious to the dissenters, he would not take back, and it was used
      against him with great effect. A Mr. Cowan, a man of no note, was selected
      as the opposing candidate, as if his enemies had determined to mortify his
      pride as well as deprive him of his seat. His speeches from the hustings
      were continually interrupted by a mob who, infuriated by fanaticism or
      whiskey, received his statements with insults, and answered his arguments
      by jeers. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; exclaimed Macaulay in one of his speeches, &ldquo;your
      representative be an honest man&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ay! but he&rsquo;s no that!&rdquo; was a cry
      that came back from the crowd. To interruptions and to insults, however,
      he presented a bold front, and met outrage with defiance. He would not
      condescend to humor at the hustings the prejudices he had offended in
      Parliament, but reaffirmed his opinions in the most pointed and explicit
      language. One of his arguments was that, in regal&rsquo;d to the Maynooth grant,
      no principle was involved. A sum had always been yearly voted to support
      that Roman Catholic College; the only cause of complaint against him was
      that he had spoken and voted for an additional sum. He was therefore
      opposed, not on a principle, but on a quibble. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;if
      you want a representative who will peril the peace of the empire for a
      mere quibble, that representative I will not be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was defeated, and after it was known that he was defeated, he was
      hissed. In his speech to the crowd, announcing that his political
      connection with Edinburgh was dissolved forever, he alluded to this last
      circumstance as unprecedented in political warfare. To hiss a defeated
      candidate, he reminded them, was below the ordinary magnanimity of the
      most factious mob. In his farewell address to the electors, written after
      he had returned to London, he indicated that, to an honest, honorable, and
      patriotic statesman, there might be solid consolations, even to personal
      pride, in the circumstances of his defeat. &ldquo;I shall always be proud,&rdquo; he
      writes, &ldquo;to think that I once enjoyed your favor, but permit me to say I
      shall remember, not less proudly, how I risked and how I lost it.&rdquo; The
      following noble poem, published since his death, contains, perhaps, the
      most authentic record of his feelings on the occasion:&mdash;

      <i>Lines Written In August, 1847.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">The day of tumult, strife, defeat, was o&rsquo;er;
      </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Worn out with toil and noise and scorn
      and spleen, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">I slumbered, and in
      slumber saw once more </span><br /> <span class="indent20">A room in an old
      mansion, long unseen. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">That room, methought, was curtained from the
      light; </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Yet through the curtains shone
      the moon&rsquo;s cold ray </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Full on a cradle,
      where, in linen white, </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Sleeping life&rsquo;s
      first soft sleep, an infant lay. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">Pale flickered on the hearth the dying flame,
      </span><br /> <span class="indent20">And all was silent in that ancient
      hall, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Save when by fits on the low
      night-wind came </span><br /> <span class="indent20">The murmur of the
      distant water-fall. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">And lo! the fairy queens who rule our birth
      </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Drew nigh to speak the new-born baby&rsquo;s
      doom: </span><br /> <span class="indent15">With noiseless step, which left
      no trace on earth, </span><br /> <span class="indent20">From gloom they
      came, and vanished into gloom. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">Not deigning on the boy a glance to cast,
      </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Swept careless by the gorgeous Queen
      of Gain; </span><br /> <span class="indent15">More scornful still, the
      Queen of Fashion passed, </span><br /> <span class="indent20">With mincing
      gait and sneer of cold disdain. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">The Queen of Power tossed high her jewelled
      head, </span><br /> <span class="indent20">And o&rsquo;er her shoulder threw a
      wrathful frown: </span><br /> <span class="indent15">The Queen of Pleasure
      on the pillow shed </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Scarce one stray
      rose-leaf from her fragrant crown. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">Still Fay in long procession followed Fay;
      </span><br /> <span class="indent20">And still the little couch remained
      unblest; </span><br /> <span class="indent15">But, when those wayward
      sprites had passed away, </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Came One, the
      last, the mightiest, and the best. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">Oh, glorious lady, with the eyes of light
      </span><br /> <span class="indent20">And laurels clustering round thy lofty
      brow, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Who by the cradle&rsquo;s side didst
      watch that night, </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Warbling a sweet
      strange music, who wast thou? </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;Yes, darling; let them go;&rdquo; so ran the
      strain: </span><br /> <span class="indent20">&ldquo;Yes; let them go, gain,
      fashion, pleasure, power, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">And all the
      busy elves to whose domain </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Belongs the
      nether sphere, the fleeting hour. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;Without one envious sigh, one anxious
      scheme, </span><br /> <span class="indent20">The nether sphere, the
      fleeting hour resign. </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Mine is the
      world of thought, the world of dream, </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Mine
      all the past, and all the future mine. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;Fortune, that lays in sport the mighty low,
      </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Age, that to penance turns the joys of
      youth, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Shall leave untouched the gifts
      which I bestow, </span><br /> <span class="indent20">The sense of beauty
      and the thirst of truth. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;Of the fair brotherhood who share my grace,
      </span><br /> <span class="indent20">I, from thy natal day, pronounce thee
      free; </span><br /> <span class="indent15">And, if for some I keep a nobler
      place, </span><br /> <span class="indent20">I keep for none a happier than
      for thee. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;There are who, while to vulgar eyes they
      seem </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Of all my bounties largely to
      partake, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Of me as of some rival&rsquo;s
      handmaid deem, </span><br /> <span class="indent20">And court me but for
      gain&rsquo;s, power&rsquo;s, fashion&rsquo;s sake. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;To such, though deep their lore, though wide
      their fame, </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Shall my great mysteries
      be all unknown: </span><br /> <span class="indent15">But thou, through good
      and evil, praise and blame, </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Wilt not
      thou love me for myself alone? </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;Yes; thou wilt love me with exceeding love;
      </span><br /> <span class="indent20">And I will tenfold all that love
      repay, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Still smiling, though the
      tender may reprove, </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Still faithful,
      though the trusted may betray. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;For aye mine emblem was, and aye shall be,
      </span><br /> <span class="indent20">The ever-during plant whose bough I
      wear, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Brightest and greenest then,
      when every tree </span><br /> <span class="indent20">That blossoms in the
      light of Time is bare. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;In the dark hour of shame, I deigned to
      stand </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Before the frowning peers at
      Bacon&rsquo;s side: </span><br /> <span class="indent15">On a far shore I
      smoothed with tender hand, </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Through
      months of pain, the sleepless bed of Hyde: </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;I brought the wise and brave of ancient days
      </span><br /> <span class="indent20">To cheer the cell where Raleigh pined
      alone: </span><br /> <span class="indent15">I lighted Milton&rsquo;s darkness
      with the blaze </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Of the bright ranks
      that guard the eternal throne. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;And even so, my child, it is my pleasure

    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;Not then alone, when myriads, closely

      drawing-rooms, thy breast </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Swells at
      the sweeter sound of woman&rsquo;s praise. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">No: when on restless night dawns cheerless

      conflict, obloquy, want, exile, thine; </span>

    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;Thine, where on mountain waves the
      snow-birds scream. </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Where more than

      scarce, through lowering clouds, one sickly gleam </span><br /> <span
      class="indent20">Lights the drear May-day of Antarctic seas; </span>

    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;Thine most, when friends turn pale, when

      He now devoted his time to a work he had long meditated, and for which he
      had not only collected a considerable portion of the materials, but had
      probably written some portion of the text,&mdash;the History of England,
      from the Accession of James II. The first two volumes of this were
      published in the autumn of 1848, and gave him a literary reputation far
      beyond what he had acquired by his historical essays. The book was as
      popular as any of Scott&rsquo;s or Dickens&rsquo;s novels, while its solid merits of
      research and generalization placed it among the great historical works of
      the century. Its circulation, large in England, was immense in the United
      States; and in every portion of the world where English literature is
      esteemed, it was widely read, either in the original text or in carefully
      prepared translations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1852, the city of Edinburgh, desirous of repairing the injustice it had
      done to Macaulay in 1847, elected him its representative without his
      appearing as a candidate. He accepted the trust, though his health had
      begun to fail, and he was already visited with the symptoms of the disease
      which eventually caused his death. He wrote to Adam Black, in August,
      1852, that &ldquo;any excitement, or any violent exertion, instantly brings on a
      derangement of the circulation, and an uneasy feeling of the heart.&rdquo; He
      was unable to perform his parliamentary duties to his own satisfaction
      from the first, and repeatedly expressed his desire to resign. He was
      withheld from so doing by the assurances he received from Edinburgh that
      his constituents were satisfied with his partial attendance on the duties
      of his post. At length, in January, 1856, he became aware of his
      incapacity to serve any longer without serious prejudice to his health,
      and resigned his seat. Meanwhile, two more volumes of his History had been
      completed and published, evincing that the energy of his mind was not
      affected by the ills of his body. He also had devoted some time to
      preparing a volume of his speeches for the press, and published them in
      1854. In 1857, without any solicitation on his part, and entirely to his
      own surprise, he was elevated to the peerage. Though it was known that his
      health was infirm, there was no apprehension on the part of the public
      that he would not live to complete a large portion of the immense work he
      had contemplated. His delightful biographies of Atterbury, Bunyan,
      Goldsmith, Johnson, and Pitt, contributed to the new edition of the
      Encyclopaedia Britannica, proved that his faculties were in their full
      vigor and splendor. It was therefore with a shock of painful surprise that
      all readers of the English race heard of his sudden death, by disease of
      the heart, on the 28th of December, 1859. It was felt, even by those who
      most vehemently disagreed with him in opinion, that in losing him England
      lost the man who, beyond all other men, carried in his brain the facts of
      her history. He was buried, with great pomp, in the Poet&rsquo;s Corner of
      Westminster Abbey, &ldquo;at the foot of Addison&rsquo;s monument and beside the
      remains of Sheridan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first and strongest impression we derive from a consideration of
      Macaulay&rsquo;s life and writings is that of the robust and masculine qualities
      of his intellect and character. Since his death it has become generally
      known that he was by no means deficient in those tender and benevolent
      feelings which found little expression in his works. Among his intimate
      friends and relations he passed as one of the most affectionate of men,
      and his benevolence to unsuccessful artists and men of letters, absorbed
      no inconsiderable portion of his income. But in his speeches in
      parliament, in his essays, and in his history, he makes the impression of
      a stout, strong, and tough polemic, who is thoroughly well furnished for
      combat, and who neither gives nor expects quarter. No tenderness to
      frailty interferes with the merciless severity of his judgments. His own
      political and personal integrity was without a stain. &ldquo;You might,&rdquo; said
      Sydney Smith, in testifying to his incorruptibility and his patriotism,
      &ldquo;lay ribbons, stars, garters, wealth, titles, before him in vain. He has
      an honest, genuine love of his country, and the world could not bribe him
      to neglect her interests.&rdquo; This integrity of character gave a certain
      puritan relentlessness of tone to his intellectual and moral judgments. He
      had a warm love for what was beautiful and true, but, in his writings, it
      generally took the negative form of hatred for what was deformed and
      false. He abhorred meanness, baseness, fraud, falsehood, conniption, and
      oppression, with his whole heart and soul, and found a grim delight in
      holding them up to public execration. His talent for this work, and his
      enjoyment of it, were so great, that he was tempted at times to hunt after
      criminality for the pleasure of punishing it. He acquired a diseased taste
      for character that was morally tainted, in order that he might exercise on
      its condemnation the rich resources of his scorn and invective. His
      progress through a tract of history was marked by the erection of the
      gallows, the gibbet, and the stake, and he was almost as insensible to
      mitigating circumstances as Judge Jeffreys himself. He seemed to consider
      that the glory of the judge rested on the number of the executions; and he
      has hanged, drawn, and quartered many individuals, whose cases are now at
      the bar of public opinion, in the course of being reheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last and finest result of personal integrity is intellectual
      conscientiousness, and this Macaulay cannot be said to have attained. His
      intellect, bright and broad as it was, was the instrument of his
      individuality. His sympathies and antipathies colored his statements, and
      he rarely exhibited anything in &ldquo;dry light.&rdquo; In this respect, he is
      inferior to Hallam and Mackintosh, who are inferior to him in extent of
      information, and genius for narrative. The vividness of his perceptions
      confirmed the autocracy of his disposition, and his convictions had to him
      the certainty of facts. It must be admitted that he had some reason for
      his dogmatism. He excelled all Englishmen of his time in his knowledge of
      English history. There was no drudgery he would not endure in order to
      obtain the most trivial fact which illustrated the opinions or the manners
      of any particular age. Indeed, the minuteness of his information
      astonished even antiquaries, and in society was sometimes thought &ldquo;to be
      erected into a colossal engine of colloquial oppression.&rdquo; And this
      information was not a mere assemblage of dead facts. It was vitalized by
      his passions and imagination; it was all alive in the many-peopled domain
      of his &ldquo;vast and joyous memory;&rdquo; and it was so completely possessed as to
      be always in readiness to sustain an argument or illustrate a principle.
      The songs, ballads, satires, lampoons, plays, private correspondence of a
      period, were as familiar to him as the graver records of its annalists.
      But in disposing his immense materials he followed the law of his own mind
      rather than the law inherent in the facts. Instead of viewing things in
      their relations to each other, he viewed things in their relation to
      himself. His representation of them, therefore, partook of the limitations
      of his character. That character was broad, but it would be absurd to say
      that it was as broad as the English race. He <i>Macaulayized</i> English
      history as a distinguished poet of the century was said to have <i>Byronized</i>
      human life. Even in some of his most seemingly triumphant statements it
      will be found that a different disposition of the facts will result in
      establishing an opposite opinion. Take the article on Bacon, the most
      glaring of all the instances in which he has refused to assume the point
      of view of the person he has resolved to condemn; and any intellect,
      resolute enough to resist the marvellous fascination of the narrative, can
      easily redispose the facts so as to arrive at an opposite conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prominent cause of Macaulay&rsquo;s popularity is to be found in the
      definiteness of his mind. He always aspired to present his matter in such
      a form as to exclude the possibility of doubt, either in his statement or
      argument. Of all great English writers he is therefore the least
      suggestive. All that he demands of a reader is simple receptiveness.
      Selection, arrangement, reasoning, pictorial representation, are all done
      by himself. This explicitness, too, is purchased at some sacrifice of
      truth. His comprehensiveness is apt to be of that kind which arrives at
      broad generalizations by excluding a number of the facts and principles it
      ought to include. Real comprehensiveness of mind is impossible unless the
      interior life of the separate facts included in the sweeping
      generalization is adequately comprehended. Shakspeare, of all English
      minds, is the most comprehensive; and Shakspeare, in virtue of his
      comprehensiveness, would doubt in many instances where Macaulay is most
      certain. The most perfect exhibition of Macaulay&rsquo;s talent is his analysis
      and representation of the character of James II., from a hostile point of
      view. He catches his victim in a series of cunningly contrived traps, and
      the poor creature, in Macaulay&rsquo;s narrative, cannot move a step without
      falling into the trap marked folly or the trap marked wickedness.
      Shakspeare&rsquo;s method of dealing with character was entirely different.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an artist Macaulay is greater in his Essays than in his History of
      England. Each of his essays is a unit. The results of analysis are
      diffused through the veins of narration, and details are strictly
      subordinated to leading conceptions. In his History details are so
      numerous as to confuse the mind. Events succeed each other in their
      chronological rather than their intellectual order; and his readers gain
      an intense perception of particular facts without any general view of the
      whole field. The power of the author to interest us is as evident in his
      account of the Bank of England as in his account of the Massacre of
      Glencoe. We pass from one topic to another without any sense of the
      connection of topics. Picture succeeds picture as in the anarchy of a
      panorama. It seems as if we were reading the work of a poet who had turned
      annalist. By emphasizing everything, interest in particulars is obtained
      at the expense of general effect. It is only by turning to the table of
      contents that we are able to generalize the events of a reign. There are
      scores of pages in the third and fourth volumes which we read as we read a
      newspaper, where an account of a murder may be succeeded immediately by an
      account of a masquerade. Prescott, who cannot be named with Macaulay in
      respect to fulness of matter, fertility of thought, originality of style,
      and unwearied energy of mind, is still superior to him in the artistic
      disposition of his materials. In reading Prescott, we have but a faint
      impression of the author and no feeling at all of the felicity of the
      style, but the real business of the historian is none the less performed,
      for we get a large view of facts in their true relations, and are enabled
      to take in the subject he treats of as a whole. In Macaulay the narrative
      of particular facts and incidents is incomparably bright and stimulating,
      but the facts and incidents are not seen from a commanding point.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his essays, especially his biographical and historical essays, this
      defect is not observable. They rank among the finest artistic products of
      the century. They partake of the imperfections of his thinking and the
      limitations of his character, but they are still perfect of their kind.
      The articles on Machiavelli, Banyan, Clive, Hastings, Frederic the Great,
      Barere, Chatham, not to mention others, are eminent specimens of that
      critical and interpretative biography, in which the character of the
      biographer appears chiefly to give unity to the representation of facts
      and the application of principles. The amount of knowledge each of them
      includes can only be estimated by those who have patiently read the many
      volumes they so brilliantly condense. In style they show a mastery of
      English which has been attained by no other English author who did not
      possess a creative imagination. The art of the writer is shown as much in
      his deliberate choice of common and colloquial phrases as in those
      splendid passages in which he almost seems to exhaust the resources of the
      English tongue. As a narrator, in his own province, it would be difficult
      to name his equal among English writers; to his narrative, all his talents
      and accomplishments combined to lend fascination; and in it he exhibited
      the understanding of Hallam, and the knowledge of Mackintosh, joined to
      the picturesqueness of Southey, and the wit of Pope.

      FRAGMENTS OF A ROMAN TALE
    </h2>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">1</span><a name="link1" id="link1"></a>(Knight&rsquo;s
      Quarterly Magazine, June 1823.) <br /> <span class="pfirst"><span
      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span><br />t was an hour after
      noon. Ligarius was returning from the Campus Martins. He strolled through
      one of the streets which led to the forum, settling his gown, and
      calculating the odds on the gladiators who were to fence at the
      approaching Saturnalia. While thus occupied, he overtook Flaminius, who,
      with a heavy-step and a melancholy face, was sauntering in the same
      direction. The light-hearted young man plucked him by the sleeve. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, Flaminius. Are you to be of Catiline&rsquo;s party this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so? Your little Tarentine girl will break her heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter. Catiline has the best cooks and the finest wine in Rome. There
      are charming women at his parties. But the twelve-line board and the
      dice-box pay for all. The Gods confound me if I did not lose two millions
      of sesterces last night. My villa at Tibur, and all the statues that my
      father the prætor <span class="pagenum">2</span><a name="link2"
       id="link2"></a>brought from Ephesus, must go to the auctioneer. That is a
      high price, you will acknowledge, even for Phonicopters, Chian, and
      Callinice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High indeed, by Pollux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is not the worst. I saw several of the leading senators this
      morning. Strange things are whispered in the higher political circles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Gods confound the political circles. I have hated the name of
      politician ever since Sylla&rsquo;s proscription, when I was within a moment of
      having my throat cut by a politician, who took me for another politician.
      While there is a cask of Falernian in Campania, or a girl in the Suburra,
      I shall be too well employed to think on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do well,&rdquo; said Flaminius gravely, &ldquo;to bestow some little
      consideration upon it at present. Otherwise, I fear, you will soon renew
      your acquaintance with politicians, in a manner quite as unpleasant as
      that to which you allude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Averting Gods! what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you. There are rumors of conspiracy. The order of things
      established by Lucius Sylla has excited the disgust of the people, and of
      a large party of the nobles. Some violent convulsion is expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that to me? I suppose that they will hardly proscribe the
      vintners and gladiators, or pass a law compelling every citizen to take a
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand. Catiline is supposed to be the author of the
      revolutionary schemes. You must have heard bold opinions at his table
      repeatedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never listen to any opinions upon such subjects, bold or timid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look to it. Your name has been mentioned.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">3</span><a
      name="link3" id="link3"></a>&ldquo;Mine! good Gods! I call heaven to witness
      that I never so much as mentioned Senate, Consul, or Comitia, in
      Catiline&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody suspects you of any participation in the inmost counsels of the
      party. But our great men surmise that you are among those whom he has
      bribed so high with beauty, or entangled so deeply in distress, that they
      are no longer their own masters. I shall never set foot within his
      threshold again. I have been solemnly warned by men who understand public
      affairs; and I advise you to be cautious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The friends had now turned into the forum, which was thronged with the gay
      and elegant youth of Rome. &ldquo;I can tell you more,&rdquo; continued Flaminius;
      &ldquo;somebody was remarking to the Consul yesterday how loosely a certain
      acquaintance of ours tied his girdle. &lsquo;Let him look to himself,&rsquo; said
      Cicero, &lsquo;or the state may find a tighter girdle for his neck.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Gods! who is it? You cannot surely mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flaminius pointed to a man who was pacing up and down the forum at a
      little distance from them. He was in the prime of manhood. His personal
      advantages were extremely striking, and were displayed with an extravagant
      but not ungraceful foppery. His gown waved in loose folds; his long dark
      curls were dressed with exquisite art, and shone and steamed with odours;
      his step and gesture exhibited an elegant and commanding figure in every
      posture of polite languor. But his countenance formed a singular contrast
      to the general appearance of his person. The high and imperial brow, the
      keen aquiline features, <span class="pagenum">4</span><a name="link4"
       id="link4"></a>the compressed mouth, the penetrating eye, indicated the
      highest degree of ability and decision. He seemed absorbed in intense
      meditation. With eyes fixed on the ground, and lips working in thought, he
      sauntered round the area, apparently unconscious how many of the young
      gallants of Rome were envying the taste of his dress, and the ease of his
      fashionable stagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo; said Ligarius, &ldquo;Caius Caesar is as unlikely to be in a plot
      as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does nothing but game, feast, intrigue, read Greek, and write verses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know nothing of Caesar. Though he rarely addresses the Senate, he is
      considered as the finest speaker there, after the Consul. His influence
      with the multitude is immense. He will serve his rivals in public life as
      he served me last night at Catiline&rsquo;s. We were playing at the twelve
      lines.(1)&mdash;Immense stakes. He laughed all the time, chatted with
      Valeria over his shoulder, kissed her hand between every two moves, and
      scarcely looked at the board. I thought that I had him. All at once I
      found my counters driven into the corner. Not a piece to move, by
      Hercules. It cost me two millions of Sesterces. All the Gods and Goddesses
      confound him for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to Valeria,&rdquo; said Ligarius, &ldquo;I forgot to ask whether you have heard
      the news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word. What?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Duodecim scripta, a game of mixed chance and skill,
     which seems to have been very fashionable in the higher
     circles of Rome. The famous lawyer Mucius was renowned for
     his skill in it.&mdash;( Cic. Oral. i. 50.)
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told at the baths to-day that Cæsar escorted <span class="pagenum">5</span><a
      name="link5" id="link5"></a>the lady home. Unfortunately old Quintus
      Lutatius had come hack from his villa in Campania, in a whim of jealousy.
      He was not expected for three days. There was a fine tumidt. The old fool
      called for his sword and his slaves, cursed his wife, and swore that he
      would cut Cæsar&rsquo;s throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Cæsar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He laughed, quoted Anacreon, trussed his gown round his left arm, closed
      with Quintus, flung him down, twisted his sword out of his hand, burst
      through the attendants, ran a freed-man through the shoulder, and was in
      the street in an instant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done! Here he comes. Good day, Caius.&rdquo; Cæsar lifted his head at the
      salutation. His air of deep abstraction vanished; and he extended a hand
      to each of the friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you after your last night&rsquo;s exploit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well as possible,&rdquo; said Cæsar laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth we should rather ask how Quintus Lutatius is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He, I understand, is as well as can be expected of a man with a faithless
      spouse and a broken head. His freed-man is most seriously hurt. Poor
      fellow! he shall have half of whatever I win to-night. Flaminius, you
      shall have your revenge at Catiline&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind. I do not intend to be at Catiline&rsquo;s till I wish to
      part with my town-house. My villa is gone already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at Catiline&rsquo;s, base spirit! You are not of his mind, my gallant
      Ligarius. Dice, Chian, and the loveliest Greek singing-girl that was ever
      seen. Think of that, Ligarius. By Venus, she almost made me adore her, by
      telling me that I talked Greek with the most Attic accent that she had
      heard in Italy.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">6</span><a name="link6"
       id="link6"></a>&ldquo;I doubt she will not say the same of me,&rdquo; replied
      Ligarius. &ldquo;I am just as able to decipher an obelisk as to read a line of
      Homer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You barbarous Scythian, who had the care of your education?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An old fool,&mdash;a Greek pedant,&mdash;a Stoic. He told me that pain
      was no evil, and flogged me as if he thought so. At last one day, in the
      middle of a lecture, I set fire to his enormous filthy beard, singed his
      face, and sent him roaring out of the house. There ended my studies. From
      that time to this I have had as little to do with Greece as the wine that
      your poor old friend Lutatius calls his delicious Samian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, Ligarius. I hate a Stoic. I wish Marcus Cato had a beard that
      you might singe it for him. The fool talked his two hours in the Senate,
      yesterday, without changing a muscle of his face. He looked as savage and
      as motionless as the mask in which Roscius acted Alecto. I detest
      everything connected with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except his sister, Servilia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. She is a lovely woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that you have told her so, Caius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that she was not angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What woman is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&mdash;but they say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter what they say. Common fame lies like a Greek rhetorician. You
      might know so much, Ligarius, without reading the philosophers. But come,
      I will introduce you to little dark-eyed Zoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I can speak no Greek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More shame for you. It is high time that you should begin. You will never
      have such a charming* <span class="pagenum">7</span><a name="link7"
       id="link7"></a>instructress. Of what was your father thinking when he sent
      for an old Stoic with a long beard to teach you? There is no
      language-mistress like a handsome woman. When I was at Athens, I learnt
      more Greek from a pretty flower-girl in the Peiræus than from all the
      Portico and the Academy. She was no Stoic, Heaven knows. But come along to
      Zoe. I will be your interpreter. Woo her in honest Latin, and I will turn
      it into elegant Greek between the throws of dice. I can make love and mind
      my game at once, as Flaminius can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, to be plain, Cæsar, Flaminius has been talking to me about
      plots, and suspicions, and politicians. I never plagued myself with such
      things since Sylla&rsquo;s and Marius&rsquo;s days; and then I never could see much
      difference between the parties. All that I am sure of is, that those who
      meddle with such affairs are generally stabbed or strangled. And, though I
      like Greek wine and handsome women, I do not wish to risk my neck for
      them. Now, tell me as a friend, Caius;&mdash;is there no danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Danger!&rdquo; repeated Cæsar, with a short, fierce, disdainful laugh: &ldquo;what
      danger do you apprehend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you should best know,&rdquo; said Flaminius; &ldquo;you are far more intimate
      with Catiline than I. But I advise you to be cautious. The leading men
      entertain strong suspicions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar drew up his figure from its ordinary state of graceful relaxation
      into an attitude of commanding dignity, and replied in a voice of which
      the deep and impassioned melody formed a strange contrast to the humorous
      and affected tone of his ordinary conversation. &ldquo;Let them suspect. They
      suspect because they know what they have deserved. What have they done
      <span class="pagenum">8</span><a name="link8" id="link8"></a>for
      Rome?&mdash;What for mankind?&mdash;Ask the citizens. Ask the provinces.
      Have they had any other object than to perpetuate their own exclusive
      power, and to keep us under the yoke of an oligarchical tyranny, which
      unites in itself the worst evils of every other system, and combines more
      than Athenian turbulence with more than Persian despotism?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Gods! Cæsar. It is not safe for you to speak, or for us to listen
      to, such things, at such a crisis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge for yourselves what you will hear. I will judge for myself what I
      will speak. I was not twenty years old, when I defied Lucius Sylla,
      surrounded by the spears of legionaries and the daggers of assassins. Do
      you suppose that I stand in awe of his paltry successors, who have
      inherited a power which they never could have acquired; who would imitate
      his proscriptions, though they have never equalled his conquests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pompey is almost as little to be trifled with as Sylla. I heard a
      consular senator say that, in consequence of the present alarming state of
      affairs, he would probably be recalled from the command assigned to him by
      the Manilian law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him come,&mdash;the pupil of Sylla&rsquo;s butcheries,&mdash;the gleaner of
      Lucullus&rsquo;s trophies,&mdash;the thief-taker of the Senate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Caius!&mdash;if you knew what the Consul said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something about himself, no doubt. Pity that such talents should be
      coupled with such cowardice and coxcombry. He is the finest speaker
      living,&mdash;infinitely superior to what Horten sins was, in his best
      days;&mdash;a charming companion, except when he tells over for the
      twentieth time all the jokes that he made at <span class="pagenum">9</span><a
      name="link9" id="link9"></a>Verres&rsquo;s trial. But he is the despicable tool
      of a despicable party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your language, Caius, convinces me that the reports which have been
      circulated are not without foundation. I will venture to prophecy that
      within a few months the republic will pass through a whole Odyssey of
      strange adventures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so; an Odyssey of which Pompey will be the Polyphemus, and
      Cicero the Siren. I would have the state imitate Ulysses: show no mercy to
      the former; but contrive, if it can be done, to listen to the enchanting
      voice of the other, without being seduced by it to destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whom can your party produce as rivals to these two famous leaders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time will show. I would hope that there may arise a man, whose genius to
      conquer, to conciliate, and to govern, may unite in one cause an oppressed
      and divided people;&mdash;may do all that Sylla should have done, and
      exhibit the magnificent spectacle of a great nation directed by a great
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is such a man to be found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps where you would least expect to find him. Perhaps he may be one
      whose powers have hitherto been concealed in domestic or literary
      retirement. Perhaps he may be one, who, while waiting for some adequate
      excitement, for some worthy opportunity, squanders on trifles a genius
      before which may yet be humbled the sword of Pompey and the gown of
      Cicero. Perhaps he may now be disputing with a sophist; perhaps prattling
      with a mistress; perhaps&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; and, as he spoke, he turned away,
      and resumed his lounge, &ldquo;strolling in the Forum.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">10</span><a
      name="link10" id="link10"></a>It was almost midnight. The party had
      separated. Catiline and Cethegus were still conferring in the supper-room,
      which was, as usual, the highest apartment of the house. It formed a
      cupola, from which windows opened on the flat roof that surrounded it. To
      this terrace Zoe had retired. With eyes dimmed with fond and melancholy
      tears, she leaned over the balustrade, to catch the last glimpse of the
      departing form of Cæsar, as it grew more and more indistinct in the
      moonlight. Had he any thought of her? Any love for her? He, the favourite
      of the high-born beauties of Rome, the most splendid, the most graceful,
      the most eloquent of its nobles? It could not be. His voice had, indeed,
      been touchingly soft whenever he addressed her. There had been a
      fascinating tenderness even in the vivacity of his look and conversation.
      But such were always the manners of Cæsar towards women. He had wreathed a
      sprig of myrtle in her hair as she was singing. She took it from her dark
      ringlets, and kissed it, and wept over it, and thought of the sweet
      legends of her own dear Greece,&mdash;of youths and girls, who, pining
      away in hopeless love, had been transformed into flowers by the compassion
      of the Gods; and she wished to become a flower, which Cæsar might
      sometimes touch, though he should touch it only to weave a crown for some
      prouder and happier mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was roused from her musings by the loud step and voice of Cethegus,
      who was pacing furiously up and down the supper-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May all the gods confound me, if Cæsar be not the deepest traitor, or the
      most miserable idiot, that ever intermeddled with a plot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoe shuddered. She drew nearer to the window. She stood concealed from
      observation by the curtain <span class="pagenum">11</span><a
      name="link11" id="link11"></a>of fine network which hung over the
      aperture, to exclude the annoying insects of the climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, too!&rdquo; continued Cethegus, turning fiercely on his accomplice;
      &ldquo;you to take his part against me!&mdash;you, who proposed the scheme
      yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Caius Cethegus, you will not understand me. I proposed the
      scheme; and I will join in executing it. But policy is as necessary to our
      plans as boldness. I did not wish to startle Cæsar&mdash;to lose his
      co-operation&mdash;perhaps to send him off with an information against us
      to Cicero and Catulus. He was so indignant at your suggestion, that all my
      dissimulation was scarcely sufficient to prevent a total rupture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indignant! The gods confound him!&mdash;He prated about humanity, and
      generosity, and moderation. By Hercules, I have not heard such a lecture
      since I was with Xenochares at Rhodes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cæsar is made up of inconsistencies. He has boundless ambition,
      unquestioned courage, admirable sagacity. Yet I have frequently observed
      in him a womanish weakness at the sight of pain. I remember that once one
      of his slaves was taken ill while carrying his litter. He alighted, put
      the fellow in his place, and walked home in a fall of snow. I wonder that
      you could be so ill-advised as to talk to him of massacre, and pillage,
      and conflagration. You might have foreseen that such propositions would
      disgust a man of his temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. I have not your self-command, Lucius. I hate such
      conspirators. What is the use of them? We must have blood&mdash;blood,&mdash;hacking
      and tearing work&mdash;bloody work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not grind your teeth, my dear Caius; and lay <span class="pagenum">12</span><a
      name="link12" id="link12"></a>down the carving-knife. By Hercules, you
      have cut up all the stuffing of the couch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter; we shall have couches enough soon,&mdash;and down to stuff
      them with,&mdash;and purple to cover them,&mdash;and pretty women to loll
      on them,&mdash;unless this fool, and such as he, spoil our plans. I had
      something else to say. The essenced fop wishes to seduce Zoe from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! you misconstrue the ordinary gallantries which he is in the
      habit of paying to every handsome face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse on his ordinary gallantries, and his Akerses, and his compliments,
      and his sprigs of myrtle! If Cæsar should dare&mdash;by Hercules, I will
      tear him to pieces in the middle of the Forum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust his destruction to me. We must use his talents and influence&mdash;thrust
      him upon every danger&mdash;make him our instrument while we are
      contending&mdash;our peace-offering to the Senate if we fail&mdash;our
      first victim if we succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark! what noise was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody in the terrace!&mdash;lend me your dagger.&rdquo; Catiline rushed to
      the window. Zoe was standing in the shade. He stepped out. She darted into
      the room&mdash;passed like a flash of lightning by the startled Cethegus&mdash;flew
      down the stairs&mdash;through the court&mdash;through the vestibule&mdash;through
      the street. Steps, voices, lights, came fast and confusedly behind her;&mdash;but
      with the speed of love and terror she gained upon her pursuers. She fled
      through the wilderness of unknown and dusky streets, till she found
      herself, breathless and exhausted, in the midst of a crowd of gallants,
      who, with chaplets on their heads, and torches in their hands, were
      reeling from the portico of a stately mansion. <span class="pagenum">13</span><a
      name="link13" id="link13"></a>The foremost of the throng was a youth whose
      slender figure and beautiful countenance seemed hardly consistent with his
      sex. But the feminine delicacy of his features rendered more frightful the
      mingled sensuality and ferocity of their expression. The libertine
      audacity of his stare, and the grotesque foppery of his apparel, seemed to
      indicate at least a partial insanity. Flinging one arm round Zoe, and
      tearing away her veil with the other, he disclosed to the gaze of his
      thronging companions the regular features and large dark eyes which
      characterise Athenian beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clodius has all the luck to-night,&rdquo; cried Ligarius. &ldquo;Not so, by
      Hercules,&rdquo; said Marcus Colius; &ldquo;the girl is fairly our common prize: we
      will fling dice for her. The Venus (1) throw, as it ought to do, shall
      decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go&mdash;let me go, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; cried Zoe, struggling with
      Clodius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a charming Greek accent she has. Come into the house, my little
      Athenian nightingale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what will become of me? If you have mothers&mdash;if you have sisters&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clodius has a sister,&rdquo; muttered Ligarius, &ldquo;or he is much belied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven, she is weeping,&rdquo; said Clodius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she were not evidently a Greek,&rdquo; said Colius, &ldquo;I should take her for a
      vestal virgin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if she were a vestal virgin,&rdquo; cried Clodius fiercely, &ldquo;it should not
      deter me. This way;&mdash;no struggling&mdash;no screaming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Struggling! screaming!&rdquo; exclaimed a gay and commanding voice; &ldquo;You are
      making very ungentle love, Clodius.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Venus was the Roman term for the highest throw on the
     dice. <span class="pagenum">14</span><a name="link14" id="link14"></a>The whole party started. Cæsar had mingled with
     them unperceived.
</pre>
    <p>
      The sound of his voice thrilled through the very heart of Zoe. With a
      convulsive effort she burst from the grasp of her insolent admirer, flung
      herself at the feet of Cæsar, and clasped his knees. The moon shone full
      on her agitated and imploring face: her lips moved; but she uttered no
      sound. He gazed at her for an instant&mdash;raised her&mdash;clasped her
      to his bosom. &ldquo;Fear nothing, my sweet Zoe.&rdquo; Then, with folded arms, and a
      smile of placid defiance, he placed himself between her and Clodius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clodius staggered forward, flushed with wine and rage, and uttering
      alternately a curse and a hiccup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Pollux, this passes a jest. Cæsar, how dare you insult me thus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A jest! I am as serious as a Jew on the Sabbath. Insult you; For such a
      pair of eyes I would insult the whole consular bench, or I should be as
      insensible as King Psammis&rsquo;s mummy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Gods, Cæsar!&rdquo; said Marcus Colius, interposing; &ldquo;you cannot think it
      worth while to get into a brawl for a little Greek girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? The Greek girls have used me as well as those of Rome. Besides,
      the whole reputation of my gallantry is at stake. Give up such a lovely
      woman to that drunken boy! My character would be gone for ever. No more
      perfumed tablets, full of vows and raptures? No more toying with fingers
      at the Circus. No more evening walks along the Tiber. No more hiding in
      chests, or jumping from windows. I, the favoured suitor of half the white
      stoles in Rome, could never again aspire above a freed-woman. You a man of
      gallantry, and think of such <span class="pagenum">14</span><a
      name="link14" id="link14_"></a>a thin, lovely woman to that drunken boy!
      My character would be gone for ever. No more perfumed tablets, full of
      vows and raptures? No more toying with fingers at the Circus. No more
      evening walks along the Tiber. No more hiding in chests, or jumping from
      windows. I, the favoured suitor of half the white stoles in Rome, could
      never again aspire above a freed-woman. You a man of gallantry, and think
      of such <span class="pagenum">15</span><a name="link15" id="link15"></a>a
      thing! For shame, my dear Colius! Do not let Clodia hear of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Cæsar spoke he had been engaged in keeping Clodius at arm&rsquo;s length.
      The rage of the frantic libertine increased as the struggle continued.
      &ldquo;Stand back, as you value your life,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I will pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this way, sweet Clodius. I have too much regard for you to suffer you
      to make love at such disadvantage. You smell too much of Falernian at
      present. Would you stifle your mistress? By Hercules, you are fit to kiss
      nobody now, except old Piso, when he is tumbling home in the morning from
      the vintners.&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      Clodius plunged his hand into his bosom, and drew a little dagger, the
      faithful companion of many desperate adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gods! he will be murdered!&rdquo; cried Zoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole throng of revellers was in agitation. The street fluctuated with
      torches and lifted hands. It was but for a moment. Cæsar watched with a
      steady eye the descending hand of Clodius, arrested the blow, seized his
      antagonist by the throat, and flung him against one of the pillars of the
      portico with such violence that he rolled, stunned and senseless, on the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is killed,&rdquo; cried several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair self-defence, by Hercules!&rdquo; said Marcus Colius. &ldquo;Bear witness, you
      all saw him draw his dagger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not dead&mdash;he breathes,&rdquo; said Ligarius. &ldquo;Carry him into the
      house; he is dreadfully bruised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the party retired with Clodius. Colius turned to Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all the Gods, Caius! you have won your (1) Cic. in Pis. <span
      class="pagenum">16</span><a name="link16" id="link16"></a>lady
      fairly. A splendid victory! You deserve a triumph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a madman Clodius has become!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intolerable. But come and sup with me on the Nones. You have no objection
      to meet the Consul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cicero? None at all. We need not talk politics. Our old dispute about
      Plato and Epicurus will furnish us with plenty of conversation. So reckon
      upon me, my dear Marcus, and farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Caesar and Zoe turned away. As soon as they were beyond hearing, she began
      in great agitation:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cæsar, you are in danger. I know all. I overheard Catiline and Cethegus.
      You are engaged in a project which must lead to certain destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My beautiful Zoe, I live only for glory and pleasure. For these I have
      never hesitated to hazard an existence which they alone render valuable to
      me. In the present case, I can assure you that our scheme presents the
      fairest hopes of success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse. You do not know&mdash;you do not understand me. I
      speak not of open peril, but of secret treachery. Catiline hates you;&mdash;Cethegus
      hates you;&mdash;your destruction is resolved. If you survive the contest,
      you perish in the first hour of victory. They detest you for your
      moderation;&mdash;they are eager for blood and plunder. I have risked my
      life to bring you this warning; but that is of little moment. Farewell!&mdash;Be
      happy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar stopped her. &ldquo;Do you fly from my thanks, dear Zoe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish not for your thanks, but for your safety;&mdash;I desire not to
      defraud Valeria or Servilia of one caress, extorted from gratitude or
      pity. Be my feelings what they may, I have learnt in a fearful school
      <span class="pagenum">17</span><a name="link17" id="link17"></a>to
      endure and to suppress them. I have been taught to abase a proud spirit to
      the claps and hisses of the vulgar:&mdash;to smile on suitors who united
      the insults of a despicable pride to the endearments of a loathsome
      fondness;&mdash;to affect sprightliness with an aching head, and eyes from
      which tears were ready to gush;&mdash;to feign love with curses on my
      lips, and madness in my brain. Who feels for me any esteem,&mdash;any
      tenderness? Who will shed a tear over the nameless grave which will soon
      shelter from cruelty and scorn the broken heart of the poor Athenian girl?
      But you, who alone have addressed her in her degradation with a voice of
      kindness and respect, farewell. Sometimes think of me,&mdash;not with
      sorrow;&mdash;no; I could bear your ingratitude, but not your distress.
      Yet, if it will not pain you too much, in distant days, when your lofty
      hopes and destinies are accomplished,&mdash;on the evening of some mighty
      victory,&mdash;in the chariot of some magnificent triumph,&mdash;think on
      one who loved you with that exceeding love which only the miserable can
      feel. Think that, wherever her exhausted frame may have sunk beneath the
      sensibilities of a tortured spirit,&mdash;in whatever hovel or whatever
      vault she may have closed her eyes,&mdash;whatever strange scenes of
      horror and pollution may have surrounded her dying bed, your shape was the
      last that swam before her sight&mdash;your voice the last sound that was
      ringing in her ears. Yet turn your face to me, Cæsar. Let me carry away
      one last look of those features, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He turned round.
      He looked at her. He hid his face on her bosom, and burst into tears. With
      sobs long and loud, and convulsive as those of a terrified child, he
      poured forth on her bosom the tribute of impetuous and uncontrollable
      emotion. He raised his head; but <span class="pagenum">18</span><a
      name="link18" id="link18"></a>he in vain struggled to restore composure to
      the brow which had confronted the frown of Sylla, and the lips which had
      rivalled the eloquence of Cicero. He several times attempted to speak, but
      in vain; and his voice still faltered with tenderness, when, after a pause
      of several minutes, he thus addressed her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own dear Zoe, your love has been bestowed on one who, if he cannot
      merit, can at least appreciate and adore you. Beings of similar
      loveliness, and similar devotedness of affection, mingled, in all my
      boyish dreams of greatness, with visions of curule chairs and ivory cars,
      marshalled legions and laurelled fasces. Such I have endeavored to find in
      the world; and, in their stead, I have met with selfishness, with vanity,
      with frivolity, with falsehood. The life which you have preserved is a
      boon less valuable than the affection&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Cæsar,&rdquo; interrupted the blushing Zoe, &ldquo;think only on your own
      security at present. If you feel as you speak,&mdash;but you are only
      mocking me,&mdash;or perhaps your compassion&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven!:&mdash;by every oath that is binding&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! alas! Cæsar, were not all the same oaths sworn yesterday to
      Valeria? But I will trust you, at least so far as to partake your present
      dangers. Flight may be necessary:&mdash;form your plans. Be they what they
      may, there is one who, in exile, in poverty, in peril, asks only to
      wander, to beg, to die with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Zoe, I do not anticipate any such necessity. To renounce the
      conspiracy without renouncing the principles on which it was originally
      undertaken,&mdash;to elude the vengeance of the Senate without losing the
      confidence of the people,&mdash;is, indeed, an arduous, but not an
      impossible, task. I owe it to myself and to my <span class="pagenum">19</span><a
      name="link19" id="link19"></a>country to make the attempt. There is still
      ample time for consideration. At present I am too happy in love to think
      of ambition or danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the door of a stately palace. Cæsar struck it. It was
      instantly opened by a slave. Zoe found herself in a magnificent hall,
      surrounded by pillars of green marble, between which were ranged the
      statues of the long line of Julian nobles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call Endymion,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The confidential freed-man made his appearance, not without a slight
      smile, which his patron&rsquo;s good nature emboldened him to hazard, at
      perceiving the beautiful Athenian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arm my slaves, Endymion; there are reasons for precaution. Let them
      relieve each other on guard during the night. Zoe, my love, my preserver,
      why are your cheeks so pale? Let me kiss some bloom into them. How you
      tremble! Endymion, a flask of Samian and some fruit. Bring them to my
      apartments. This way, my sweet Zoe.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      ON THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LITERATURE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">20</span><a name="link20" id="link20"></a>(Knight&rsquo;s
      Quarterly Magazine, June 1823.) <br /> <span class="pfirst"><span
      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span><br />his is the age of
      societies. There is scarcely one Englishman in ten who has not belonged to
      some association for distributing books, or for prosecuting them; for
      sending invalids to the hospital, or beggars to the treadmill; for giving
      plate to the rich or blankets to the poor. To be the most absurd
      institution among so many institutions is no small distinction; it seems,
      however, to belong indisputably to the Royal Society of Literature. At the
      first establishment of that ridiculous academy, every sensible man
      predicted that, in spite of regal patronage and episcopal management, it
      would do nothing, or do harm. And it will scarcely be denied that those
      expectations have hitherto been fulfilled. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not attack the founders of the association. Their characters are
      respectable; their motives, I am willing to believe, were laudable. But I
      feel, and it is the duty of every literary man to feel, a strong jealousy
      of their proceedings. Their society can be innocent only while it
      continues to be despicable. Should they ever possess the power to
      encourage merit, they must also possess the power to depress it. Which
      power will be more frequently exercised, let every one who has studied
      literary history, let every one who has studied human nature, declare.
      <span class="pagenum">21</span><a name="link21" id="link21"></a>Envy
      and faction insinuate themselves into all communities. They often disturb
      the peace, and pervert the decisions, of benevolent and scientific
      associations. But it is in literary academies that they exert the most
      extensive and pernicious influence. In the first place, the principles of
      literary criticism, though equally fixed with those on which the chemist
      and the surgeon proceed, are by no means equally recognised. Men are
      rarely able to assign a reason for their approbation or dislike on
      questions of taste; and therefore they willingly submit to any guide who
      boldly asserts his claim to superior discernment. It is more difficult to
      ascertain and establish the merits of a poem than the powers of a machine
      or the benefits of a new remedy. Hence it is in literature, that quackery
      is most easily puffed, and excellence most easily decried.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some degree this argument applies to academies of the fine arts; and it
      is fully confirmed by all that I have ever heard of that institution which
      annually disfigures the walls of Somerset-House with an acre of spoiled
      canvass. But a literary tribunal is incomparably more dangerous. Other
      societies, at least, have no tendency to call forth any opinions on those
      subjects which most agitate and inflame the minds of men. The sceptic and
      the zealot, the revolutionist and the placeman, meet on common ground in a
      gallery of paintings or a laboratory of science. They can praise or
      censure without reference to the differences which exist between them. In
      a literary body this can never be the case. Literature is, and always must
      be, inseparably blended with politics and theology; it is the great engine
      which moves the feelings of a people on the most momentous questions. It
      is, therefore, impossible that any society can be formed so impartial as
      to <span class="pagenum">22</span><a name="link22" id="link22"></a>consider
      the literary character of an individual abstracted from the opinions which
      his writings inculcate. It is not to be hoped, perhaps it is not to be
      wished, that the feelings of the man should be so completely forgotten in
      the duties of the academician. The consequences are evident. The honours
      and censures of this Star-chamber of the Muses will be awarded according
      to the prejudices of the particular sect or faction which may at the time
      predominate. Whigs would canvass against a Southey, Tories against a
      Byron. Those who might at first protest against such conduct as unjust
      would soon adopt it on the plea of retaliation; and the general good of
      literature, for which the society was professedly instituted, would be
      forgotten in the stronger claims of political and religious partiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet even this is not the worst. Should the institution ever acquire any
      influence, it will afford most pernicious facilities to every malignant
      coward who may desire to blast a reputation which he envies. It will
      furnish a secure ambuscade, behind which the Maroons of literature may
      take a certain and deadly aim. The editorial <i>we</i> has often been
      fatal to rising genius; though all the world knows that it is only a form
      of speech, very often employed by a single needy blockhead. The academic
      <i>we</i> would have a far greater and more ruinous influence. Numbers,
      while they increased the effect, would diminish the shame, of injustice.
      The advantages of an open and those of an anonymous attack would be
      combined; and the authority of avowal would be united to the security of
      concealment. The serpents in Virgil, after they had destroyed Laocoön,
      found an asylum from the vengeance of the enraged people behind the shield
      of the statue of Minerva. And, in the same manner, every <span
      class="pagenum">23</span><a name="link23" id="link23"></a>thing that
      is grovelling and venomous, every thing that can hiss, and every thing
      that can sting, would take sanctuary in the recesses of this new temple of
      wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French academy was, of all such associations, the most widely and the
      most justly celebrated. It was founded by the greatest of ministers; it
      was patronised by successive kings; it numbered in its lists most of the
      eminent French writers. Yet what benefit has literature derived from its
      labours? What is its history but an uninterrupted record of servile
      compliances&mdash;of paltry artifices&mdash;of deadly quarrels&mdash;of
      perfidious friendships? Whether governed by the Court, by the Sorbonne, or
      by the Philosophers, it was always equally powerful for evil, and equally
      impotent for good. I might speak of the attacks by which it attempted to
      depress the rising fame of Corneille; I might speak of the reluctance with
      which it gave its tardy confirmation to the applauses which the whole
      civilised world had bestowed on the genius of Voltaire. I might prove by
      overwhelming evidence that, to the latest period of its existence, even
      under the superintendence of the all-accomplished D&rsquo;Alembert, it continued
      to be a scene of the fiercest animosities and the basest intrigues. I
      might cite Piron&rsquo;s epigrams, and Marmontel&rsquo;s memoirs, and Montesquieu&rsquo;s
      letters. But I hasten on to another topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the modes by which our Society proposes to encourage merit is the
      distribution of prizes. The munificence of the king has enabled it to
      offer an annual premium of a hundred guineas for the best essay in prose,
      and another of fifty guineas for the best poem, which may be transmitted
      to it. This is very laughable. In the first place the judges may err.
      Those imperfections of human intellect to which, as <span class="pagenum">24</span><a
      name="link24" id="link24"></a>the articles of the church tell us, even
      general councils are subject may possibly be found even in the Royal
      Society of Literature. The French academy, as I have already said, was the
      most illustrious assembly of the kind, and numbered among its associates
      men much more distinguished than ever will assemble at Mr. Hatchard&rsquo;s to
      rummage the box of the English Society. Yet this famous body gave a
      poetical prize, for which Voltaire was a candidate, to a fellow who wrote
      some verses about <i>the frozen and the burning pole</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, granting that the prizes were always awarded to the best composition,
      that composition, I say without hesitation, will always be bad. A prize
      poem is like a prize sheep. The object of the competitor for the
      agricultural premium is to produce an animal fit, not to be eaten, but to
      be weighed. Accordingly he pampers his victim into morbid and unnatural
      fitness; and, when it is in such a state that it would be sent away in
      disgust from any table, he offers it to the judges. The object of the
      poetical candidate, in like manner, is to produce, not a good poem, but a
      poem of that exact degree of frigidity or bombast which may appear to his
      censors to be correct or sublime. Compositions thus constructed will
      always be worthless. The few excellences which they may contain will have
      an exotic aspect and flavour. In general, prize sheep are good for nothing
      but to make tallow candles, and prize poems are good for nothing but to
      light them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first subject proposed by the Society to the poets of England was
      Dartmoor. I thought that they intended a covert sarcasm at their own
      projects. Their institution was a literary Dartmoor scheme;&mdash;a plan
      for forcing into cultivation the waste lands of intellect,&mdash;for
      raising poetical produce, by means of bounties. <span class="pagenum">25</span><a
      name="link25" id="link25"></a>from soil too meagre to have yielded any
      returns in the natural course of things. The plan for the cultivation of
      Dartmoor has, I hear, been abandoned. I hope that this may be an omen of
      the fate of the Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, this seems by no means improbable. They have been offering for
      several years the rewards which the king placed at their disposal, and
      have not, as far as I can learn, been able to find in their box one
      composition which they have deemed worthy of publication. At least no
      publication has taken place. The associates may perhaps be astonished at
      this. But I will attempt to explain it, after the manner of ancient times,
      by means of an apologue.
    </p>
    <p>
      About four hundred years after the deluge, King Gomer Chephoraod reigned
      in Babylon. He united all the characteristics of an excellent sovereign.
      He made good laws, won great battles, and white-washed long streets. He
      was, in consequence, idolised by his people, and panegyrised by many poets
      and orators. A book was then a serious undertaking; Neither paper nor any
      similar material had been invented. Authors were therefore under the
      necessity of inscribing their compositions on massive bricks. Some of
      these Babylonian records are still preserved in European museums; but the
      language in which they are written has never been deciphered. Gomer
      Chephoraod was so popular that the clay of all the plains round the
      Euphrates could scarcely furnish brick-kilns enough for his eulogists. It
      is recorded in particular that Pharonezzar, the Assyrian Pindar, published
      a bridge and four walls in his praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the king was going in state from his palace to the temple of
      Belus. During this procession it was lawful for any Babylonian to offer
      any petition or suggestion <span class="pagenum">26</span><a
      name="link26" id="link26"></a>to his sovereign. As the chariot passed
      before a vintner&rsquo;s shop, a large company, apparently half-drunk, sallied
      forth into the street; and one of them thus addressed the king:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gomer Chephoraod, live for ever! It appears to thy servants that of all
      the productions of the earth good wine is the best, and bad wine is the
      worst. Good wine makes the heart cheerful, the eyes bright, the speech
      ready. Bad wine confuses the head, disorders the stomach, makes us
      quarrelsome at night, and sick the next morning. Now therefore let my lord
      the king take order that thy servants may drink good wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is this to be done?&rdquo; said the good-natured prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, King,&rdquo; said his monitor, &ldquo;this is most easy. Let the king make a
      decree, and seal it with his royal signet: and let it be proclaimed that
      the king will give ten she-asses, and ten slaves, and ten changes of
      raiment, every year, unto the man who shall make ten measures of the best
      wine. And whosoever wishes for the she-asses, and the slaves, and the
      raiment, let him send the ten measures of wine to thy servants, and we
      will drink thereof and judge. So shall there be much good wine in
      Assyria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The project pleased Gomer Chephoraod. &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said he. The people
      shouted. The petitioners prostrated themselves in gratitude. The same
      night heralds were despatched to bear the intelligence to the remotest
      districts of Assyria.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a due interval the wines began to come in; and the examiners
      assembled to adjudge the prize. The first vessel was unsealed. Its odour
      was such that the judges, without tasting it, pronounced unanimous <span
      class="pagenum">27</span><a name="link27" id="link27"></a>condemnation.
      The next was opened: it had a villainous taste of clay. The third was sour
      and vapid. They proceeded from one cask of execrable liquor to another,
      till at length, in absolute nausea, they gave up the investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning they all assembled at the gate of the king, with pale
      faces and aching heads. They owned that they could not recommend any
      competitor as worthy of the rewards. They swore that the wine was little
      better than poison, and intreated permission to resign the office of
      deciding between such detestable potions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of Belus, how can this have happened?&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merolchazzar, the high-priest, muttered something about the anger of the
      Gods at the toleration shown to a sect of impious heretics who ate pigeons
      broiled, &ldquo;whereas,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;our religion commands us to eat them
      roasted. Now therefore, oh King,&rdquo; continued this respectable divine, &ldquo;give
      command to thy men of war, and let them smite the disobedient people with
      the sword, them, and their wives, and their children, and let their
      houses, and their flocks, and their herds, be given to thy servants the
      priests. Then shall the land yield its increase, and the fruits of the
      earth shall be no more blasted by the vengeance of heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;the ground lies under no general curse from heaven.
      The season has been singularly good. The wine which thou didst thyself
      drink at the banquet a few nights ago, oh venerable Merolchazzar, was of
      this year&rsquo;s vintage. Dost thou not remember how thou didst praise it? It
      was the same night that thou wast inspired by Belus, and didst reel to and
      fro, and discourse sacred mysteries. These <span class="pagenum">28</span><a
      name="link28" id="link28"></a>things are too hard for me. I comprehend
      them not. The only wine which is had is that which is sent to my judges.
      Who can expound this to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king scratched his head. Upon which all the courtiers scratched their
      heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then ordered proclamation to be made, that a purple robe and a golden
      chain should be given to the man who could solve this difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old philosopher, who had been observed to smile rather disdainfully
      when the prize had first been instituted, came forward and spoke thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gomer Chephoraod, live for ever! Marvel not at that which has happened.
      It was no miracle, but a natural event. How could it be otherwise? It is
      true that much good wine has been made this year. But who would send it in
      for thy rewards? Thou know-est Ascobaruch who hath the great vineyards in
      the north, and Cohahiroth who sendeth wine every year from the south over
      the Persian gulf. Their wines are so delicious that ten measures thereof
      are sold for an hundred talents of silver. Thinkest thou that they will
      exchange them for thy slaves and thine asses? What would thy prize profit
      any who have vineyards in rich soils?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who then,&rdquo; said one of the judges, &ldquo;are the wretches who sent us this
      poison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blame them not,&rdquo; said the sage, &ldquo;seeing that you have been the authors of
      the evil. They are men whose lands are poor, and have never yielded them
      any returns equal to the prizes which the king proposed. Wherefore,
      knowing that the lords of the fruitful vineyards would not enter into
      competition with them, they planted vines, some on rocks, and some in
      light sandy soil, and some in deep clay. Hence <span class="pagenum">29</span><a
      name="link29" id="link29"></a>their wines are bad. For no culture or
      reward will make barren land bear good vines. Know therefore, assuredly,
      that your prizes have increased the quantity of bad but not of good wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. At length the king spoke. &ldquo;Give him the purple
      robe and the chain of gold. Throw the wines into the Euphrates; and
      proclaim that the Royal Society of Wines is dissolved.&rdquo;

     (1) This game consisted in projecting wine out of cups; it

     synonymous with beggary. See Aristophanes; Plutus, 602. From

      a review of Italian literature, Dante has a double claim to precedency. He
      was the earliest and the greatest writer of his country. He was the first
      man who fully descried and exhibited the powers of his native dialect. The
      Latin tongue, which, under the most favourable circumstances, and in the
      hands of the greatest masters, had still been poor, feeble, and singularly
      unpoetical, and which had, in the age of Dante, been debased by the
      admixture of innumerable barbarous words and idioms, was still cultivated
      with superstitious veneration, and received, in the last stage of
      corruption, more honours than it had deserved in the period of its life
      and vigour. It was the language of the cabinet, of the university, of the
      church. It was employed by all who aspired to distinction in the higher
      walks of poetry. In compassion to the ignorance of his mistress, a
      cavalier might now and then proclaim his passion in Tuscan or Provençal
      rhymes. The vulgar might occasionally be edified by a pious <span
      class="pagenum">56</span><a name="link56" id="link56"></a>allegory in
      the popular jargon. But no writer had conceived it possible that the
      dialect of peasants and market-women should possess sufficient energy and
      precision for a majestic and durable work. Dante adventured first. He
      detected the rich treasures of thought and diction which still lay latent
      in their ore. He refined them into purity. He burnished them into
      splendour. He fitted them for every purpose of use and magnificence. And
      he has thus acquired the glory, not only of producing the finest narrative
      poem of modern times, but also of creating a language, distinguished by
      unrivalled melody, and peculiarly capable of furnishing to lofty and
      passionate thoughts their appropriate garb of severe and concise
      expression. </span>

      To many this may appear a singular panegyric on the Italian tongue. Indeed
      the great majority of the young gentlemen and young ladies, who, when they
      are asked whether they read Italian, answer &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; never go beyond the
      stories at the end of their grammar,&mdash;The Pastor Fido,&mdash;or an
      act of Artaserse. They could as soon read a Babylonian brick as a canto of
      Dante. Hence it is a general opinion, among those who know little or
      nothing of the subject, that this admirable language is adapted only to
      the effeminate cant of sonnetteers, musicians, and connoisseurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is that Dante and Petrarch have been the Oromasdes and Arimanes
      of Italian literature. I wish not to detract from the merits of Petrarch.
      No one can doubt that his poems exhibit, amidst some imbecility and more
      affectation, much elegance, ingenuity, and tenderness. They present us
      with a mixture which can only be compared to the whimsical concert
      described by the humorous poet of Modena:
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">57</span><a name="link57" id="link57"></a>I am
      not, however, at present speaking of the intrinsic excellencies of his
      writings, which I shall take another opportunity to examine, hut of the
      effect which they produce on the literature of Italy. The florid and
      luxurious charms of his style enticed the poets and the public from the
      contemplation of nobler and sterner models. In truth, though a rude state
      of society is that in which great original works are most frequently
      produced, it is also that in which they are worst appreciated. This may
      appear paradoxical, but it is proved by experience, and is consistent with
      reason. To be without any received canons of taste is good for the few who
      can create, but bad for the many who can only imitate and judge. Great and
      active minds cannot remain at rest. In a cultivated age they are too often
      contented to move on in the beaten path. But where no path exists they
      will make one. Thus the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Divine Comedy, appeared in
      dark and half barbarous times: and thus of the few original works which
      have been produced in more polished ages, we owe a large proportion to men
      in low stations and of uninformed minds. I will instance, in our own
      language, the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress and Robinson Crusoe. Of all the prose
      works of fiction which we possess, these are, I will not say the best, but
      the most peculiar, the most unprecedented, the most inimitable. Had Bunyan
      and Defoe been educated gentlemen, they would probably have published
      translations and imitations of French romances &ldquo;by a person of quality.&rdquo; I
      am not sure that we should have had Lear if Shakspeare had been able to
      read Sophocles.

      <span class="pagenum">58</span><a name="link58" id="link58"></a>But
      these circumstances, while they foster genius, are unfavourable to the
      science of criticism. Men judge by comparison. They are unable to estimate
      the grandeur of an object when there is no standard by which they can
      measure it. One of the French philosophers (I beg Gerard&rsquo;s pardon), who
      accompanied Napoleon to Egypt, tells us that, when he first visited the
      great Pyramid, he was surprised to see it so diminutive. It stood alone in
      a boundless plain. There was nothing near it from which he could calculate
      its magnitude. But when the camp was pitched beside it, and the tents
      appeared like diminutive specks around its base, he then perceived the
      immensity of this mightiest work of man. In the same manner, it is not
      till a crowd of petty writers has sprung up that the merit of the great
      master-spirits of literature is understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have indeed ample proof that Dante was highly admired in his own and
      the following age. I wish that we had equal proof that he was admired for
      his excellencies. But it is a remarkable corroboration of what has been
      said, that this great man seems to have been utterly unable to appreciate
      himself. In his treatise <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i>, he talks with
      satisfaction of what he has done for Italian literature, of the purity and
      correctness of his style. &ldquo;<i>Cependant</i>,&rdquo; says a favourite (1) writer
      of mine, &ldquo;<i>il ri est ni pur, ni correct, mais il est créateur.&rdquo;</i>Considering
      the difficulties with which Dante had to struggle, we may perhaps be more
      inclined than the French critic to allow him this praise. Still it is by
      no means his highest or most peculiar title to applause. It is scarcely
      necessary to say that those qualities which escaped the notice of the poet
      himself were not likely to attract the attention of the commentators. The
      fact is, that, while the

      <span class="pagenum">59</span><a name="link59" id="link59"></a>public
      homage was paid to some absurdities with which his works may be justly
      charged, and to many more which were falsely imputed to them,&mdash;while
      lecturers were paid to expound and eulogise his physics, his metaphysics,
      his theology, all bad of their kind,&mdash;while annotators laboured to
      detect allegorical meanings of which the author never dreamed, the great
      powers of his imagination, and the incomparable force of his style, were
      neither admired nor imitated. Arimanes had prevailed. The Divine Comedy
      was to that age what St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral was to Omai. The poor Otaheitean
      stared listlessly for a moment at the huge cupola, and ran into a toyshop
      to play with beads. Italy, too, was charmed with literary trinkets, and
      played with them for four centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time of Petrarch to the appearance of Alfieri&rsquo;s tragedies, we may
      trace in almost every page of Italian literature the influence of those
      celebrated sonnets which, from the nature both of their beauties and their
      faults, were peculiarly unfit to be models for general imitation. Almost
      all the poets of that period, however different in the degree and quality
      of their talents, are characterised by great exaggeration, and, as a
      necessary consequence, great coldness of sentiment; by a passion for
      frivolous and tawdry ornament; and, above all, by an extreme feebleness
      and diffuseness of style. Tasso, Marino, Guarini, Metastasio, and a crowd
      of writers of inferior merit and celebrity, were spell-bound in the
      enchanted gardens of a gaudy and meretricious Alcina, who concealed
      debility and deformity beneath the deceitful semblance of loveliness and
      health. Ariosto, the great Ariosto himself, like his own Ruggiero, stooped
      for a time to linger amidst the magic flowers and fountains, and to caress
      the gay <span class="pagenum">60</span><a name="link60" id="link60"></a>and
      painted sorceress. But to him, as to his own Ruggiero, had been given the
      omnipotent ring and the winged courser, which bore him from the paradise
      of deception to the regions of light and nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evil of which I speak was not confined to the graver poets. It
      infected satire, comedy, burlesque. No person can admire more than I do
      the great masterpieces of wit and humour which Italy has produced. Still I
      cannot but discern and lament a great deficiency, which is common to them
      all. I find in them abundance of ingenuity, of droll naïveté, of profound
      and just reflection, of happy expression. Manners, characters, opinions,
      are treated with &ldquo;a most learned spirit of human dealing.&rdquo; But something
      is still wanting. We read, and we admire, and we yawn. We look in vain for
      the bacchanalian fury which inspired the comedy of Athens, for the fierce
      and withering scorn which animates the invectives of Juvenal and Dryden,
      or even for the compact and pointed diction which adds zest to the verses
      of Pope and Boileau. There is no enthusiasm, no energy, no condensation,
      nothing which springs from strong feeling, nothing which tends to excite
      it. Many fine thoughts and fine expressions reward the toil of reading.
      Still it is a toil. The Secchia Rapita, in some points the best poem of
      its kind, is painfully diffuse and languid. The Animali Parlanti of Casti
      is perfectly intolerable. I admire the dexterity of the plot, and the
      liberality of the opinions. I admit that it is impossible to turn to a
      page which does not contain something that deserves to be remembered; but
      it is at least six times as long as it ought to be. And the garrulous
      feebleness of the style is a still greater fault than the length of the
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be thought that I have gone too far in attributing
<span class="pagenum">61</span><a name="link61" id="link61"></a>
these evils to the influence of the works and the fame of Petrarch. It cannot,
      however, be doubted that they have arisen, in a great measure, from a
      neglect of the style of Dante. This is not more proved by the decline of
      Italian poetry than by its resuscitation. After the lapse of four hundred
      and fifty years, there appeared a man capable of appreciating and
      imitating the father of Tuscan literature&mdash;Vittorio Alfieri. Like the
      prince in the nursery tale, he sought and found the Sleeping Beauty within
      the recesses which had so long concealed her from mankind. The portal was
      indeed rusted by time;&mdash;the dust of ages had accumulated on the
      banonnors;&mdash;the furniture was of antique fashion;&mdash;and the
      gorgeous colour of the embroidery had faded. But the living charms which
      were well worth all the rest remained in the bloom of eternal youth, and
      well rewarded the bold adventurer who roused them from their long slumber.
      In every line of the Philip and the Saul, the greatest poems, I think, of
      the eighteenth century, we may trace the influence of that mighty genius
      which has immortalised the ill-starred love of Francesca, and the paternal
      agonies of Ugolino. Alfieri bequeathed the sovereignty of Italian
      literature to the author of the Aristodemus&mdash;a man of genius scarcely
      inferior to his own, and a still more devoted disciple of the great
      Florentine. It must be acknowledged that this eminent writer has sometimes
      pushed too far his idolatry of Dante. To borrow a sprightly illustration
      from Sir John Denham, he has not only imitated his garb, but borrowed his
      clothes. He often quotes his phrases; and he has, not very judiciously as
      it appears to me, imitated his versification. Nevertheless, he has
      displayed many of the higher excellencies of his master; <span
      class="pagenum">62</span><a name="link62" id="link62"></a>and his
      works may justly inspire us with a hope that Italian language will long
      flourish under a new literary dynasty, or rather under the legitimate
      line, which has at length been restored to a throne long occupied by
      specious usurpers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man to whom the literature of his country owes its origin and its
      revival was horn in times singularly adapted to call forth his
      extraordinary powers. Religious zeal, chivalrous love and honour,
      democratic liberty, are the three most powerful principles that have ever
      influenced the character of large masses of men. Each of them singly has
      often excited the greatest enthusiasm, and produced the most important
      changes. In the time of Dante all the three, often in amalgamation,
      generally in conflict, agitated the public mind. The preceding generation
      had witnessed the wrongs and the revenge of the brave, the accomplished,
      the unfortunate Emperor Frederic the Second,&mdash;a poet in an age of
      schoolmen,&mdash;a philosopher in an age of monks,&mdash;a statesman in an
      age of crusaders. During the whole life of the poet, Italy was
      experiencing the consequences of the memorable struggle which he had
      maintained against the Church. The finest works of imagination have always
      been produced in times of political convulsion, as the richest vineyards
      and the sweetest flowers always grow on the soil which has been fertilised
      by the fiery deluge of a volcano. To look no further than the literary
      history of our own country, can we doubt that Shakspeare was in a great
      measure produced by the Reformation, and Wordsworth by the French
      Revolution? Poets often avoid political transactions; they often affect to
      despise them. But, whether they perceive it or not, they must be
      influenced by them. As long as their minds have any <span class="pagenum">63</span><a
      name="link63" id="link63"></a>point of contact with those of their
      fellow-men, the electric impulse, at whatever distance it may originate,
      will he circuitously communicated to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will be the case even in large societies, where the division of
      labour enables many speculative men to observe the face of nature, or to
      analyse their own minds, at a distance from the seat of political
      transactions. In the little republic of which Dante was a member the state
      of things was very different. These small communities are most
      unmercifully abused by most of our modern professors of the science of
      government. In such states, they tell us, factions are always most
      violent: where both parties are cooped up within a narrow space, political
      difference necessarily produces personal malignity. Every man must be a
      soldier; every moment may produce a war. No citizen can lie down secure
      that he shall not be roused by the alarum-bell, to repel or avenge an
      injury. In such petty quarrels Greece squandered the blood which might
      have purchased for her the permanent empire of the world, and Italy wasted
      the energy and the abilities which would have enabled her to defend her
      independence against the Pontiffs and the Cæsars.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this is true: yet there is still a compensation. Mankind has not
      derived so much benefit from the empire of Rome as from the city of
      Athens, nor from the kingdom of France as from the city of Florence. The
      violence of party feeling may be an evil; but it calls forth that activity
      of mind which in some states of society it is desirable to produce at any
      expense. Universal soldiership may be an evil; but where every man is a
      soldier there will be no standing army. And is it no evil that one man in
      every fifty should be bred to the trade of slaughter; should live only by
      destroying <span class="pagenum">64</span><a name="link64" id="link64"></a>and
      by exposing himself to be destroyed; should fight without enthusiasm and
      conquer without glory; be sent to a hospital when wounded, and rot on a
      dunghill when old? Such, over more than two-thirds of Europe, is the fate
      of soldiers. It was something that the citizen of Milan or Florence
      fought, not merely in the vague and rhetorical sense in which the words
      are often used, but in sober truth, for his parents, his children, his
      lands, his house, his altars. It was something that he marched forth to
      battle beneath the Carroccio, which had been the object of his childish
      veneration; that his aged father looked down from the battlements on his
      exploits; that his friends and his rivals were the witnesses of his glory.
      If he fell, he was consigned to no venal or heedless guardians. The same
      day saw him conveyed within the walls which he had defended. His wounds
      were dressed by his mother; his confession was whispered to the friendly
      priest who had heard and absolved the follies of his youth; his last sigh
      was breathed upon the lips of the lady of his love. Surely there is no
      sword like that which is beaten out of a ploughshare. Surely this state of
      things was not unmixedly bad: its evils were alleviated by enthusiasm and
      by tenderness; and it will at least be acknowledged that it was well
      fitted to nurse poetical genius in an imaginative and observant mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did the religious spirit of the age tend less to this result than its
      political circumstances. Fanaticism is an evil, but it is not the greatest
      of evils. It is good that a people should be roused by any means from a
      state of utter torpor;&mdash;that their minds should be diverted from
      objects merely sensual, to meditations, however erroneous, on the
      mysteries of the moral and intellectual world; and from interests which
      are immediately <span class="pagenum">65</span><a name="link65"
       id="link65"></a>selfish to those which relate to the past, the future, and
      the remote. These effects have sometimes been produced by the worst
      superstitions that ever existed; but the Catholic religion, even in the
      time of its utmost extravagance and atrocity, never wholly lost the spirit
      of the Great Teacher, whose precepts form the noblest code, as his conduct
      furnished the purest example, of moral excellence. It is of all religions
      the most poetical. The ancient superstitions furnished the fancy with
      beautiful images, but took no hold on the heart. The doctrines of the
      Reformed Churches have most powerfully influenced the feelings and the
      conduct of men, but have not presented them with visions of sensible
      beauty and grandeur. The Roman Catholic Church has united to the awful
      doctrines of the one what Mr. Coleridge calls the &ldquo;fair humanities&rdquo; of the
      other. It has enriched sculpture and painting with the loveliest and most
      majestic forms. To the Phidian Jupiter it can oppose the Moses of Michael
      Angelo; and to the voluptuous beauty of the Queen of Cyprus, the serene
      and pensive loveliness of the Virgin Mother. The legends of its martyrs
      and its saints may vie in ingenuity and interest with the mythological
      fables of Greece; its ceremonies and processions were the delight of the
      vulgar; the huge fabric of secular power with which it was connected
      attracted the admiration of the statesman. At the same time, it never lost
      sight of the most solemn and tremendous doctrines of Christianity,&mdash;the
      incarnate God,&mdash;the judgment,&mdash;the retribution,&mdash;the
      eternity of happiness or torment. Thus, while, like the ancient religions,
      it received incalculable support from policy and ceremony, it never wholly
      became, like those religions, a merely political and ceremonial
      institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">66</span><a name="link66" id="link66"></a>The
      beginning of the thirteenth century was, as Machiarelli has remarked, the
      era of a great revival of this extraordinary system. The policy of
      Innocent,&mdash;the growth of the inquisition and the mendicant orders,&mdash;the
      wars against the Albigenses, the Pagans of the East, and the unfortunate
      princes of the house of Swabia, agitated Italy during the two following
      generations. In this point Dante was completely under the influence of his
      age. He was a man of a turbid and melancholy spirit. In early youth he had
      entertained a strong and unfortunate passion, which, long after the death
      of her whom he loved, continued to haunt him. Dissipation, ambition,
      misfortunes had not effaced it. He was not only a sincere, but a
      passionate, believer. The crimes and abuses of the Church of Pome were
      indeed loathsome to him; but to all its doctrines and all its rites he
      adhered with enthusiastic fondness and veneration; and, at length, driven
      from nis native country, reduced to a situation the most painful to a man
      of his disposition, condemned to learn by experience that no (1) food is
      so bitter as the bread of dependence, and no ascent so painful as the
      staircase of a patron,&mdash;his wounded spirit took refuge in visionary
      devotion. Beatrice, the unforgotten object of his early tenderness, was
      invested by his imagination with glorious and mysterious attributes; she
      was enthroned among the highest of the celestial hierarchy: Almighty
      Wisdom had assigned to her the care of the sinful and unhappy wanderer who
      had loved her with such a perfect love. (2) By a confusion, like that

      But those religious hopes which had released the mind of the sublime
      enthusiast from the terrors of death had not rendered his speculations on
      human life more cheerful. This is an inconsistency which may often be
      observed in men of a similar temperament. He hoped for happiness beyond
      the grave: but he felt none on earth. It is from this cause, more than
      from any other, that his description of Heaven is so far inferior to the
      Hell or the Purgatory. With the passions and miseries of the suffering
      spirits he feels a strong sympathy. But among the beatified he appears as
      one who has nothing in common with them,&mdash;as one who is incapable of
      comprehending, not only the degree, but the nature of their enjoyment. We
      think that we see him standing; amidst those smiling; and radiant spirits
      with that scowl of unutterable misery on his brow, and that curl of bitter
      disdain on his lips, which all his portraits have preserved and which
      might furnish Chantrey with hints for the head of his projected Satan.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no poet whose intellectual and moral character are so closely
      connected. The great source, as it appears to me, of the power of the
      Divine Comedy is the strong belief with which the story seems to be told.
      In this respect, the only books which approach to its excellence are
      Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels and Robinson Crusoe. The solemnity of his
      asseverations, the consistency and minuteness of his details, the
      earnestness with which he labors to make the reader understand the exact
      shape and size of every thing that he describes, give an air of reality to
      his wildest fictions. <span class="pagenum">68</span><a name="link68"
       id="link68"></a>I should only weaken this statement by quoting instances
      of a feeling which pervades the whole work, and to which it owes much of
      its fascination. This is the real justification of the many passages in
      his poem which had critics have condemned as grotesque. I am concerned to
      see that Mr. Cary, to whom Dante owes more than ever poet owed to
      translator, has sanctioned an accusation utterly unworthy of his
      abilities. &ldquo;His solicitude,&rdquo; says that gentleman, &ldquo;to define all his
      images in such a manner as to bring them within the circle of our vision,
      and to subject them to the power of the pencil, renders him little better
      than grotesque, where Milton has since taught us to expect sublimity.&rdquo; It
      is true that Dante has never shrunk from embodying his conceptions in
      determinate words, that he has even given measures and numbers, where
      Milton would have left his images to float undefined in a gorgeous haze of
      language. Both were right. Milton did not profess to have been in heaven
      or hell. He might therefore reasonably confine himself to magnificent
      generalities. Far different was the office of the lonely traveller, who
      had wandered through the nations of the dead. Had he described the abode
      of the rejected spirits in language resembling the splendid lines of the
      English poet,&mdash;had he told us of

      this would doubtless have been noble writing. But where would have been
      that strong impression of <span class="pagenum">69</span><a
      name="link69" id="link69"></a>reality, which, in accordance with his plan,
      it should have been his great object to produce? It was absolutely
      necessary for him to delineate accurately &ldquo;all monstrous, all prodigious
      things,&rdquo;&mdash;to utter what might to others appear &ldquo;unutterable,&rdquo;&mdash;to
      relate with the air of truth what fables had never feigned,&mdash;to
      embody what fear had never conceived. And I will frankly confess that the
      vague sublimity of Milton affects me less than these reviled details of
      Dante. We read Milton; and we know that we are reading a great poet. When
      we read Dante, the poet vanishes. We are listening to the man who has
      returned from the valley of the &ldquo;dolorous abyss;&rdquo; (1)&mdash;we seem to see
      the dilated eye of horror, to hear the shuddering accents with which he
      tells his fearful tale. Considered in this light, the narratives are
      exactly what they should be,&mdash;definite in themselves, but suggesting
      to the mind ideas of awful and indefinite wonder. They are made up of the
      images of the earth:&mdash;they are told in the language of the earth.&mdash;Yet
      the whole effect is, beyond expression, wild and unearthly. The fact is,
      that supernatural beings, as long as they are considered merely with
      reference to their own nature, excite our feelings very feebly. It is when
      the great gulf which separates them from us is passed, when we suspect
      some strange and un definable relation between the laws of the visible and
      the invisible world, that they rouse, perhaps, the strongest emotions of
      which our nature is capable. How many children, and how many men, are
      afraid of ghosts, who are not afraid of God! And this, because, though
      they entertain a much stronger conviction of the existence of a Deity than
      of the reality of apparitions, they have no

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">70</span><a name="link70" id="link70"></a>apprehension
      that he will manifest himself to them in any sensible manner. While this
      is the case, to describe super-human beings in the language, and to
      attribute to them the actions, of humanity may be grotesque,
      unphilosophical, inconsistent; but it will be the only mode of working
      upon the feelings of men, and, therefore, the only mode suited for poetry.
      Shakspeare understood this well, as he understood every thing that
      belonged to his art. Who does not sympathise with the rapture of Ariel,
      flying after sunset on the wings of the bat, or sucking in the cups of
      flowers with the bee? Who does not shudder at the caldron of Macbeth?
      Where is the philosopher who is not moved when he thinks of the strange
      connection between the infernal spirits and &ldquo;the sow&rsquo;s blood that hath
      eaten her nine farrow?&rdquo; But this difficult task of representing
      supernatural beings to our minds, in a manner which shall be neither
      unintelligible to our intellects, nor wholly inconsistent with our ideas
      of their nature, has never been so well performed as by Dante. I will
      refer to three instances, which are, perhaps, the most striking&mdash;-the
      description of the transformations of the serpents and the robbers, in the
      twenty-fifth canto of the Inferno,&mdash;the passage concerning Nimrod, in
      the thirty-first canto of the same part,&mdash;and the magnificent
      procession in the twenty-ninth canto of the Purgatorio.
    </p>
    <p>
      The metaphors and comparisons of Dante harmonise admirably with that air
      of strong reality of which I have spoken. They have a very peculiar
      character. He is perhaps the only poet whose writings would become much
      less intelligible if all illustrations of this sort were expunged. His
      similes are frequently rather those of a traveller than of a poet. He
      employs them <span class="pagenum">71</span><a name="link71"
       id="link71"></a>not to display his ingenuity by fanciful analogies,&mdash;not
      to delight the reader by affording him a distant and passing glimpse of
      beautiful images remote from the path in which he is proceeding,&mdash;but
      to give an exact idea of the objects which he is describing, by comparing
      them with others generally known. The boiling pitch in Malebolge was like
      that in the Venetian arsenal:&mdash;the mound on which he travelled along
      the banks of Phlegethon was like that between Ghent and Bruges, but not so
      large:&mdash;the cavities where the Simoniacal prelates are confined
      resembled the fonts in the Church of John at Florence. Every reader of
      Dante will recall many other illustrations of this description, which add
      to the appearance of sincerity and earnestness from winch the narrative
      derives so much of its interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of his comparisons, again, are intended to give an exact idea of his
      feelings under particular circumstances. The delicate shades of grief, of
      fear, of anger, are rarely discriminated with sufficient accuracy in the
      language of the most refined nations. A rude dialect never abounds in nice
      distinctions of this kind. Dante therefore employs the most accurate and
      infinitely the most poetical mode of marking the precise state of his
      mind. Every person who has experienced the bewildering effect of sudden
      bad tidings,&mdash;the stupefaction,&mdash;the vague doubt of the truth of
      our own perceptions which they produce,&mdash;will understand the
      following simile:&mdash;&ldquo;I was as he is who dreameth his own harm,&mdash;who,
      dreaming, wishes that it may be all a dream, so that he desires that which
      is as though it were not.&rdquo; This is only one out of a hundred equally
      striking and expressive similitudes. The comparisons of Homer and Milton
      are magnificent digressions. It scarcely injures their effect to detach
      <span class="pagenum">72</span><a name="link72" id="link72"></a>them
      from the work. Those of Dante are very different. They derive their beauty
      from the context, and reflect beauty upon it. His embroidery cannot be
      taken out without spoiling the whole web. I cannot dismiss this part of
      the subject without advising every person who can muster sufficient
      Italian to read the smile of the sheep, in the third canto of the
      Purgatorio. I think it the most perfect passage of the kind in the world,
      the most imaginative, the most picturesque, and the most sweetly
      expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      No person can have attended to the Divine Comedy without observing how
      little impression the forms of the external world appear to have made on
      the mind of Dante. His temper and his situation had led him to fix his
      observation almost exclusively on human nature. The exquisite opening of
      the eighth (1) canto of the Purgatorio affords a strong instance of this.
      He leaves to others the earth, the ocean, and the sky. His business is
      with man. To other writers, evening may be the season of dews and stars
      and radiant clouds. To Dante it is the hour of fond recollection and
      passionate devotion,&mdash;the hour which melts the heart of the mariner
      and kindles the love of the pilgrim,&mdash;the hour when the toll of the
      bell seems to mourn for another day which is gone and will return no more.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) I cannot help observing that Gray&rsquo;s imitation of that
     noble line &ldquo;Che paia&rsquo;l giorno pianger che si muore,&rdquo; is one
     of the most striking instances of injudicious plagiarism
     with which I am acquainted. Dante did not put this strong
     personification at the beginning of his description. The
     imagination of the reader is so well prepared for it by the
     previous lines, that it appears perfectly natural and
     pathetic. Placed as Gray has placed it, neither preceded nor
     followed by any thing that harmonises with it, it becomes a
     frigid conceit. Woe to the unskilful rider who ventures on
     the horses of Achilles.

      of blue-stocking ladies and sonneteering gentlemen seem to consider a
      strong sensibility to the &ldquo;splendour of the grass, the glory of the

      The orthodox poetical creed is more Catholic. The noblest earthly object
      of the contemplation of man is man himself. The universe, and all its fair
      and glorious forais, are indeed included in the wide empire of the
      imagination; but she has placed her home and her sanctuary amidst the
      inexhaustible varieties and the impenetrable mysteries of the mind.

      Othello is perhaps the greatest work in the world. From what does it
      derive its power? From the clouds? From the ocean? From the mountains? Or
      from love strong as death, and jealousy cruel as the grave! What is it
      that we go forth to see in Hamlet? Is it a reed shaken with the wind? A
      small celandine? A bed of daffodils? Or is it to contemplate a mighty and
      wayward mind laid bare before us to the inmost recesses? It may perhaps be
      doubted whether the lakes and the hills are better fitted for the
      education of a poet than the dusky streets of a huge capital. Indeed who
      is not tired to death with pure description of

</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">74</span><a name="link74" id="link74"></a>scenery?
      Is it not the fact, that external objects never strongly excite our
      feelings but when they are contemplated in reference to man, as
      illustrating his destiny, or as influencing his character? The most
      beautiful object in the world, it will be allowed, is a beautiful woman.
      But who that can analyse his feelings is not sensible that she owes her
      fascination less to grace of outline and delicacy of colour, than to a
      thousand associations which, often unperceived by ourselves, connect those
      qualities with the source of our existence, with the nourishment of our
      infancy, with the passions of our youth, with the hopes of our age, with
      elegance, with vivacity, with tenderness, with the strongest of natural
      instincts, with the dearest of social ties?
    </p>
    <p>
      To those who think thus, the insensibility of the Florentine poet to the
      beauties of nature will not appear an unpardonable deficiency. On mankind
      no writer, with the exception of Shakspeare, has looked with a more
      penetrating eye. I have said that his poetical character had derived a
      tinge from his peculiar temper. It is on the sterner and darker passions
      that he delights to dwell. All love, excepting the half mystic passion
      which he still felt for his buried Beatrice, had palled on the fierce and
      restless exile. The sad story of Rimini is almost a single exception. I
      know not whether it has been remarked, that, in one point, misanthropy
      seems to have affected his mind as it did that of Swift. Nauseous and
      revolting images seem to have had a fascination for his mind; and he
      repeatedly places before his readers, with all the energy of his
      incomparable style, the most loathsome objects of the sewer and the
      dissecting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another peculiarity in the poem of Dante, which, I think,
      deserves notice. Ancient mythology <span class="pagenum">75</span><a
      name="link75" id="link75"></a>has hardly ever been successfully interwoven
      with modern poetry. One class of writers have introduced the fabulous
      deities merely as allegorical representatives of love, wine, or wisdom.
      This necessarily renders their works tame and cold. We may sometimes
      admire their ingenuity; but with what interest can we read of beings of
      whose personal existence the writer does not suffer us to entertain, for a
      moment, even a conventional belief? Even Spenser&rsquo;s allegory is scarcely
      tolerable, till we contrive to forget that Una signifies innocence, and
      consider her merely as an oppressed lady under the protection of a
      generous knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those writers who have, more judiciously, attempted to preserve the
      personality of the classical divinities have failed from a different
      cause. They have been imitators, and imitators at a disadvantage;
      Euripides and Catullus believed in Bacchus and Cybele as little as we do.
      But they lived among men who did. Their imaginations, if not their
      opinions, took the colour of the age. Hence the glorious inspiration of
      the Bacchæ and the Atys. Our minds are formed by circumstances: and I do
      not believe that it would be in the power of the greatest modern poet to
      lash himself up to a degree of enthusiasm adequate to the production of
      such works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dante alone, among the poets of later times, has been, in this respect,
      neither an allegorist nor an imitator; and, consequently, he alone has
      introduced the ancient fictions with effect. His Minos, his Charon, his
      Pluto, are absolutely terrific. Nothing can be more beautiful or original
      than the use which lie has made of the river of Lethe. He has never
      assigned to his mythological characters any functions inconsistent with
      the creed of the Catholic Church. He has <span class="pagenum">76</span><a
      name="link76" id="link76"></a>related nothing concerning them which a good
      Christian of that age might not believe possible. On this account, there
      is nothing in these passages that appears puerile or pedantic. On the
      contrary, this singular use of classical names suggests to the mind a
      vague and awful idea of some mysterious revelation, anterior to all
      recorded history, of which the dispersed fragments might have been
      retained amidst the impostures and superstitions of later religions.
      Indeed the mythology of the Divine Comedy is of the elder and more
      colossal mould. It breathes the spirit of Homer and Æschylus, not of Ovid
      and Claudian.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the more extraordinary, since Dante seems to have been utterly
      ignorant of the Greek language; and his favorite Latin models could only
      have served to mislead him. Indeed, it is impossible not to remark his
      admiration of writers far inferior to himself; and, in particular, his
      idolatry of Virgil, who, elegant and splendid as he is, has no pretensions
      to the depth and originality of mind which characterise his Tuscan
      worshipper. In truth, it may be laid down as an almost universal rule that
      good poets are bad critics. Their minds are under the tyranny of ten
      thousand associations imperceptible to others. The worst writer may easily
      happen to touch a spring which is connected in their minds with a long
      succession of beautiful images. They are like the gigantic slaves of
      Aladdin, gifted with matchless power, but bound by spells so mighty that
      when a child whom they could have crushed touched a talisman, of whose
      secret he was ignorant, they immediately became his vassals. It has more
      than once happened to me to see minds, graceful and majestic as the
      Titania of Shakspeare, bewitched by the charms of an ass&rsquo;s head, bestowing
      on it the fondest <span class="pagenum">77</span><a name="link77"
       id="link77"></a>caresses, and crowning it with the sweetest flowers. I
      need only mention the poems attributed to Ossian. They are utterly
      worthless, except as an edifying instance of the success of a story
      without evidence, and of a book without merit. They are a chaos of words
      which present no image, of images which have no archetype:&mdash;they are
      without form and void; and darkness is upon the face of them. Yet how many
      men of genius have panegyrised and imitated them!
    </p>
    <p>
      The style of Dante is, if not his highest, perhaps his most peculiar
      excellence. I know nothing with which it can be compared. The noblest
      models of Greek composition must yield to it. His words are the fewest and
      the best which it is possible to use. The first expression in which he
      clothes his thoughts is always so energetic and comprehensive that
      amplification would only injure the effect. There is probably no writer in
      any language who has presented so many strong pictures to the mind. Yet
      there is probably no writer equally concise. This perfection of style is
      the principal merit of the Paradiso, which, as I have already remarked, is
      by no means equal in other respects to the two preceding parts of the
      poem. The force and felicity of the diction, however, irresistibly attract
      the reader through the theological lectures and the sketches of
      ecclesiastical biography, with which this division of the work too much
      abounds. It may seem almost absurd to quote particular specimens of an
      excellence which is diffused over all his hundred cantos. I will, however,
      instance the third canto of the Inferno, and the sixth of the Purgatorio,
      as passages incomparable in their kind. The merit of the latter is,
      perhaps, rather oratorical than poetical; nor can I recollect any thing in
      the great Athenian speeches <span class="pagenum">78</span><a
      name="link78" id="link78"></a>which equals it in force of invective and
      bitterness of sarcasm. I have heard the most eloquent statesman of the age
      remark that, next to Demosthenes, Dante is the writer who ought to be most
      attentively studied by every man who desires to attain oratorical
      eminence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is time to close this feeble and rambling critique. I cannot
      refrain, however, from saying a few words upon the translations of the
      divine comedy. Boyd&rsquo;s is as tedious and languid as the original is rapid
      and forcible. The strange measure which he has chosen, and, for ought I
      know, invented, is most unfit for such a work. Translations ought never to
      be written in a verse which requires much command of rhyme. The stanza
      becomes a bed of Procrustes; and the thoughts of the unfortunate author
      are alternately racked and curtailed to fit their new receptacle. The
      abrupt and yet consecutive style of Dante suffers more than that of any
      other poet by a version diffuse in style, and divided into paragraphs, for
      they deserve no other name, of equal length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be said in favour of Hayley&rsquo;s attempt, but that it is better
      than Boyd&rsquo;s. His mind was a tolerable specimen of filagree work,&mdash;rather
      elegant, and very feeble. All that can be said for his best works is that
      they are neat. All that can be said against his worst is that they are
      stupid. He might have translated Metastasio tolerably. But he was utterly
      unable to do justice to the

      I turn with pleasure from these wretched performances to Mr. Cary&rsquo;s

      present I will only say that there is no other version in the world, as
      far as I know, so faithful, yet that there is no other version which so
      fully proves that the translator is himself a man of poetical genius.
      Those who are ignorant of the Italian language should read it to become
      acquainted with the Divine Comedy. Those who are most intimate with
      Italian literature should read it for its original merits: and I believe
      that they will find it difficult to determine whether the author deserves
      most praise for his intimacy with the language of Dante, or for his
      extraordinary mastery over his own.

      to name a writer whose celebrity, when both its extent and its duration
      are taken into the account, can be considered as equal to that of
      Petrarch. Four centuries and a half have elapsed since his death. Yet
      still the inhabitants of every nation throughout the western world are as
      familiar with his character and his adventures as with the most
      illustrious names, and the most recent anecdotes, of their own literary
      history. This is indeed a rare distinction. His detractors must
      acknowledge that it could not have been acquired by a poet destitute of
      merit. His admirers will scarcely maintain that the unassisted merit of
      Petrarch could have raised him to that eminence which has not yet been

    <p>
      It is not difficult to discover some of the causes to which this great man
      has owed a celebrity, which I <span class="pagenum">81</span><a
      name="link81" id="link81"></a>cannot but think disproportioned to his real
      claims on the admiration of mankind. In the first place, he is an egotist.
      Egotism in conversation is universally abhorred. Lovers, and, I believe,
      lovers alone, pardon it in each other. No services, no talents, no powers
      of pleasing, render it endurable. Gratitude, admiration, interest, fear,
      scarcely prevent those who are condemned to listen to it from indicating
      their disgust and fatigue. The childless uncle, the powerful patron, can
      scarcely extort this compliance. We leave the inside of the mail in a
      storm, and mount the box, rather than hear the history of our companion.
      The chaplain bites his lips in the presence of the archbishop. The
      midshipman yawns at the table of the First Lord. Yet, from whatever cause,
      this practice, the pest of conversation, gives to writing a zest which
      nothing else can impart. Rousseau made the boldest experiment of this
      kind; and it fully succeeded. In our own time Lord Byron, by a series of
      attempts of the same nature, made himself the object of general interest
      and admiration. Wordsworth wrote with egotism more intense, but less
      obvious; and he has been rewarded with a sect of worshippers,
      comparatively small in number, but far more enthusiastic in their
      devotion. It is needless to multiply instances. Even now all the walks of
      literature are infested with mendicants for fame, who attempt to excite
      our interest by exhibiting all the distortions of their intellects, and
      stripping the covering from all the putrid sores of their feelings. Nor
      are there wanting many who push their imitation of the beggars whom they
      resemble a step further, and who find it easier to extort a pittance from
      the spectator, by simulating deformity and debility from which they are
      exempt, than by such <span class="pagenum">82</span><a name="link82"
       id="link82"></a>honest labour as their health and strength enable them to
      perform. In the mean time the credulous public pities and pampers a
      nuisance which requires only the tread-mill and the whip. This art, often
      successful when employed by dunces, gives irresistible fascination to
      works which possess intrinsic merit. We are always desirous to know
      something of the character and situation of those whose writings we have
      perused with pleasure. The passages in which Milton has alluded to his own
      circumstances are perhaps read more frequently, and with more interest,
      than any other lines in his poems. It is amusing to observe with what
      labour critics have attempted to glean from the poems of Homer some hints
      as to his situation and feelings. According to one hypothesis, he intended
      to describe himself under the name of Demodocus. Others maintain that he
      was the identical Phemius whose life Ulysses spared. This propensity of
      the human mind explains, I think, in a great degree, the extensive
      popularity of a poet whose works are little else than the expression of
      his personal feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second place, Petrarch was not only an egotist, but an amatory
      egotist. The hopes and fears, the joys and sorrows, which he described,
      were derived from the passion which of all passions exerts the widest
      influence, and which of all passions borrows most from the imagination. He
      had also another immense advantage. He was the first eminent amatory poet
      who appeared after the great convulsion which had changed, not only the
      political, but the moral, state of the world. The Greeks, who, in their
      public institutions and their literary tastes, were diametrically opposed
      to the oriental nations, bore a considerable resemblance to those nations
      in their domestic habits. Like them, they <span class="pagenum">83</span><a
      name="link83" id="link83"></a>despised the intellects and immured the
      persons of their women; and it was among the least of the fright-fid evils
      to which this pernicious system gave birth, that all the accomplishments
      of mind, and all the fascinations of manner, which, in a highly-cultivated
      age, will generally be necessary to attach men to their female associates,
      were monopolised by the Phrynes and the Lamias. The indispensable
      ingredients of honourable and chivalrous love were nowhere to be found
      united. The matrons and their daughters, confined in the harem,&mdash;insipid,
      uneducated, ignorant of all but the mechanical arts, scarcely seen till
      they were married,&mdash;could rarely excite interest; while their
      brilliant rivals, half graces, half harpies, elegant and informed, but
      fickle and rapacious, could never inspire respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of society in Rome was, in this point, far happier; and the
      Latin literature partook of the superiority. The Roman poets have
      decidedly surpassed those of Greece in the delineation of the passion of
      love. There is no subject which they have treated with so much success.
      Ovid, Catullus, Tibullus, Horace, and Propertius, in spite of all their
      faults, must be allowed to rank high in this department of the art. To
      these I would add my favourite Plautus; who, though he took his plots from
      Greece, found, I suspect, the originals of his enchanting female
      characters at Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still many evils remained: and, in the decline of the great empire, all
      that was pernicious in its domestic institutions appeared more strongly.
      Under the influence of governments at once dependent and tyrannical, which
      purchased, by cringing to their enemies, the power of trampling on their
      subjects, the Romans sunk <span class="pagenum">84</span><a
      name="link84" id="link84"></a>into the lowest state of effeminacy and
      debasement. Falsehood, cowardice, sloth, conscious and unrepining
      degradation, formed the national character. Such a character is totally
      incompatible with the stronger passions. Love, in particular, which, in
      the modern sense of the word, implies protection and devotion on the one
      side, confidence on the other, respect and fidelity on both, could not
      exist among the sluggish and heartless slaves who cringed around the
      thrones of Honorius and Augustulus. At this period the great renovation
      commenced. The warriors of the north, destitute as they were of knowledge
      and humanity, brought with them, from their forests and marshes, those
      qualities without which humanity is a weakness, and knowledge a curse,&mdash;energy&mdash;independence&mdash;the
      dread of shame&mdash;the contempt of danger. It would be most interesting
      to examine the manner in which the admixture of the savage conquerors and
      the effeminate slaves, after many generations of darkness and agitation,
      produced the modern European character;&mdash;to trace back, from the
      first conflict to the final amalgamation, the operation of that mysterious
      alchemy, which, from hostile and worthless elements, has extracted the
      pure gold of human nature&mdash;to analyse the mass, and to determine the
      proportions in which the ingredients are mingled. But I will confine
      myself to the subject to which I have more particularly referred. The
      nature of the passion of love had undergone a complete change. It still
      retained, indeed, the fanciful and voluptuous character which it had
      possessed among the southern nations of antiquity. But it was tinged with
      the superstitious veneration with which the northern warriors had been
      accustomed to regard women. Devotion and war had <span class="pagenum">85</span><a
      name="link85" id="link85"></a>imparted to it their most solemn and
      animating feelings. It was sanctified by the blessings of the Church, and
      decorated with the wreaths of the tournament. Venus, as in the ancient
      fable, was again rising above the dark and tempestuous waves which had so
      long covered her beauty. But she rose not now, as of old, in exposed and
      luxurious loveliness. She still wore the eestus of her ancient witchcraft;
      but the diadem of Juno was on her brow, and the ægis of Pallas in her
      hand. Love might, in fact, be called a new passion; and it is not
      astonishing that the first poet of eminence who wholly devoted his genius
      to this theme should have excited an extraordinary sensation. He may be
      compared to an adventurer who accidentally lands in a rich and unknown
      island; and who, though he may only set up an ill-shaped cross upon the
      shore, acquires possession of its treasures, and gives it his name. The
      claim of Petrarch was indeed somewhat like that of Amerigo Vespucci to the
      continent which should have derived its appellation from Columbus. The
      Provençal poets were unquestionably the masters of the Florentine. But
      they wrote in an age which could not appreciate their merits; and their
      imitator lived at the very period when composition in the vernacular
      language began to attract general attention. Petrarch was in literature
      what a Valentine is in love. The public preferred him, not because his
      merits were of a transcendent order, but because he was the first person
      whom they saw after they awoke from their long sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did Petrarch gain less by comparison with his immediate successors
      than with those who had preceded him. Till more than a century after his
      death Italy produced no poet who could be compared to him. This decay of
      genius is doubtless to be ascribed, in a <span class="pagenum">86</span><a
      name="link86" id="link86"></a>great measure, to the influence which his
      own works had exercised upon the literature of his country. Yet it has
      conduced much to his fame. Nothing is more favourable to the reputation of
      a writer than to be succeeded by a race inferior to himself; and it is an
      advantage, from obvious causes, much more frequently enjoyed by those who
      corrupt the national taste than by those who improve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another cause has co-operated with those which I have mentioned to spread
      the renown of Petrarch. I mean the interest which is inspired by the
      events of his life&mdash;an interest which must have been strongly felt by
      his contemporaries, since, after an interval of five hundred years, no
      critic can be wholly exempt from its influence. Among the great men to
      whom we owe the resuscitation of science he deserves the foremost place;
      and his enthusiastic attachment to this great cause constitutes his most
      just and splendid title to the gratitude of posterity. He was the votary
      of literature. He loved it with a perfect love. He worshipped it with an
      almost fanatical devotion. He was the missionary, who proclaimed its
      discoveries to distant countries&mdash;the pilgrim, who travelled far and
      wide to collect its reliques&mdash;the hermit, who retired to seclusion to
      meditate on its beauties&mdash;the champion, who fought its battles&mdash;the
      conqueror, who, in more than a metaphorical sense, led barbarism and
      ignorance in triumph, and received in the capitol the laurel which his
      magnificent victory had earned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be conceived more noble or affecting than that ceremony. The
      superb palaces and porticoes, by which had rolled the ivory chariots of
      Marius and Cæsar, had long mouldered into dust. The laurelled fasces&mdash;the
      golden eagles&mdash;the shouting legions&mdash;<span class="pagenum">87</span><a
      name="link87" id="link87"></a>the captives and the pictured cities&mdash;were
      indeed wanting to his victorious procession. The sceptre had passed away
      from Rome. But she still retained the mightier influence of an
      intellectual empire, and was now to confer the prouder reward of an
      intellectual triumph. To the man who had extended the dominion of her
      ancient language&mdash;who had erected the trophies of philosophy and
      imagination in the haunts of ignorance and ferocity&mdash;whose captives
      were the hearts of admiring nations enchained by the influence of his song&mdash;whose
      spoils were the treasures of ancient genius rescued from obscurity and
      decay&mdash;the Eternal City offered the just and glorious tribute of her
      gratitude. Amidst the ruined monuments of ancient and the infant erections
      of modern art, he who had restored the broken link between the two ages of
      human civilization was crowned with the wreath which he had deserved from
      the moderns who owed to him their refinement&mdash;from the ancients who
      owed to him their fame. Never was a coronation so august witnessed by
      Westminster or by Rheims.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we turn from this glorious spectacle to the private chamber of the
      poet,&mdash;when we contemplate the struggle of passion and virtue,&mdash;the
      eye dimmed, the cheek furrowed, by the tears of sinful and hopeless
      desire,&mdash;when we reflect on the whole history of his attachment, from
      the gay fantasy of his youth to the lingering despair of his age, pity and
      affection mingle with our admiration. Even after death had placed the last
      seal on his misery, we see him devoting to the cause of the human mind all
      the strength and energy which love and sorrow had spared. He lived the
      apostle of literature;&mdash;he fell its martyr:&mdash;he was found dead
      with his head reclined on a book. <span class="pagenum">88</span><a
      name="link88" id="link88"></a>Those who have studied the life and writings
      of Petrarch with attention, will perhaps be inclined to make some
      deductions from this panegyric. It cannot be denied that his merits were
      disfigured by a most unpleasant affectation. His zeal for literature
      communicated a tinge of pedantry to all his feelings and opinions. His
      love was the love of a sonnetteer:&mdash;his patriotism was the patriotism
      of an antiquarian. The interest with which we contemplate the works, and
      study the history, of those who, in former ages, have occupied our
      country, arises from the associations which connect them with the
      community in which are comprised all the objects of our affection and our
      hope. In the mind of Petrarch these feelings were reversed. He loved
      Italy, because it abounded with the monuments of the ancient masters of
      the world. His native city&mdash;the fair and glorious Florence&mdash;the
      modern Athens, then in all the bloom and strength of its youth, could not
      obtain, from the most distinguished of its citizens, any portion of that
      passionate homage which he paid to the decrepitude of Rome. These and many
      other blemishes, though they must in candour be acknowledged, can but in a
      very slight degree diminish the glory of his career. For my own part, I
      look upon it with so much fondness and pleasure that I feel reluctant to
      turn from it to the consideration of his works, which I by no means
      contemplate with equal admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, I think highly of the poetical powers of Petrarch. He did
      not possess, indeed, the art of strongly presenting sensible objects to
      the imagination;&mdash;and this is the more remarkable, because the talent
      of which I speak is that which peculiarly distinguishes the Italian poets.
      In the Divine Comedy it is displayed <span class="pagenum">89</span><a
      name="link89" id="link89"></a>in its highest perfection. It characterises
      almost every celebrated poem in the language. Perhaps this is to be
      attributed to the circumstance, that painting and sculpture had attained a
      high degree of excellence in Italy before poetry had been extensively
      cultivated. Men were debarred from books, but accustomed from childhood to
      contemplate the admirable works of art, which, even in the thirteenth
      century, Italy began to produce. Hence their imaginations received so
      strong a bias that, even in their writings, a taste for graphic
      delineation is discernible. The progress of things in England has been in
      all respects different. The consequence is, that English historical
      pictures are poems on canvass; while Italian poems are pictures painted to
      the mind by means of words. Of this national characteristic the writings
      of Petrarch are almost totally destitute. His sonnets indeed, from their
      subject and nature, and his Latin poems, from the restraints which always
      shackle one who writes in a dead language, cannot fairly be received in
      evidence. But his Triumphs absolutely required the exercise of this
      talent, and exhibit no indications of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genius, however, he certainly possessed, and genius of a high order. His
      ardent, tender, and magnificent turn of thought, his brilliant fancy, his
      command of expression, at once forcible and elegant, must be acknowledged.
      Nature meant him for the prince of lyric writers. But by one fatal present
      she deprived her other gifts of half their value. He would have been a
      much greater poet had he been a less clever man. His ingenuity was the
      bane of his mind. He abandoned the noble and natural style, in which he
      might have excelled, for the conceits which he produced with a facility at
      once admirable and disgusting. His muse <span class="pagenum">90</span><a
      name="link90" id="link90"></a>like the Roman lady in Livy, was tempted by
      gaudy ornaments to betray the fastnesses of her strength, and, like her,
      was crushed beneath the glittering bribes which had seduced her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paucity of his thoughts is very remarkable. It is impossible to look
      without amazement on a mind so fertile in combinations, yet so barren of
      images. His amatory poetry is wholly made up of a very few topics,
      disposed in so many orders, and exhibited in so many lights, that it
      reminds us of those arithmetical problems about permutations, which so
      much astonish the unlearned. The French cook, who boasted that he could
      make fifteen different dishes out of a nettle-top, was not a greater
      master of his art. The mind of Petrarch was a kaleidoscope. At every turn
      it presents us with new forms, always fantastic, occasionally beautiful;
      and we can scarcely believe that all these varieties have been produced by
      the same worthless fragments of glass. The sameness of his images is,
      indeed, in some degree, to be attributed to the sameness of his subject.
      It would be unreasonable to expect perpetual variety from so many hundred
      compositions, all of the same length, all in the same measure, and all
      addressed to the same insipid and heartless coquette. I cannot but suspect
      also that the perverted taste, which is the blemish of his amatory verses,
      was to be attributed to the influence of Laura, who probably, like most
      critics of her sex, preferred a gaudy to a majestic style. Be this as it
      may, he no sooner changes his subject than he changes his manner. When he
      speaks of the wrongs and degradation of Italy, devastated by foreign
      invaders, and but feebly defended by her pusillanimous children, the
      effeminate lisp of the sonnetteer is exchanged for a cry, wild, and
      solemn, and piercing as <span class="pagenum">91</span><a
      name="link91" id="link91"></a>that which proclaimed &ldquo;Sleep no more&rdquo; to the
      bloody house of Cawdor. &ldquo;Italy seems not to feel her sufferings,&rdquo; exclaims
      her impassioned poet; &ldquo;decrepit, sluggish, and languid, will she sleep for
      ever? Will there be none to awake her? Oh that I had my hands twisted in
      her hair!&rdquo; (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is it with less energy that he denounces against the Mahometan Babylon
      the vengeance of Europe and of Christ. His magnificent enumeration of the
      ancient exploits of the Greeks must always excite admiration, and cannot
      be perused without the deepest interest, at a time when the wise and good,
      bitterly disappointed in so many other countries, are looking with
      breathless anxiety towards the natal land of liberty,&mdash;the field of
      Marathon,&mdash;and the deadly pass where the Lion of Lacedæmon turned to
      bay. (2)
    </p>
    <p>
      His poems on religious subjects also deserve the highest commendation. At
      the head of these must be placed the Ode to the Virgin. It is, perhaps,
      the finest hymn in the world. His devout veneration receives an
      exquisitely poetical character from the delicate perception of the sex and
      the loveliness of his idol, which we may easily trace throughout the whole
      composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could dwell with pleasure on these and similar parts of the writings of
      Petrarch; but I must return to his amatory poetry: to that he entrusted
      his fame; and to that he has principally owed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prevailing defect of his best compositions on this subject is the
      universal brilliancy with which they

      <span class="pagenum">92</span><a name="link92" id="link92"></a>are
      lighted up. The natural language of the passions is, indeed, often
      figurative and fantastic; and with none is this more the case than with
      that of love. Still there is a limit. The feelings should, indeed, have
      their ornamental garb; but, like an elegant woman, they should be neither
      muffled nor exposed. The drapery should be so arranged, as at once to
      answer the purposes of modest concealment and judicious display. The
      decorations should sometimes be employed to hide a defect, and sometimes
      to heighten a beauty; but never to conceal, much less to distort, the
      charms to which they are subsidiary. The love of Petrarch, on the
      contrary, arrays itself like a foppish savage, whose nose is bored with a
      golden ring, whose skin is painted with grotesque forms and dazzling
      colours, and whose ears are drawn down his shoulders by the weight of
      jewels. It is a rule, without any exception, in all kinds of composition,
      that the principal idea, the predominant feeling, should never be
      confounded with the accompanying decorations. It should generally be
      distinguished from them by greater simplicity of expression; as we
      recognise Napoleon in the pictures of his battles, amidst a crowd of
      embroidered coats and plumes, by his grey cloak and his hat without a
      feather. In the verses of Petrarch it is generally impossible to say what
      thought is meant to be prominent. All is equally elaborate. The chief
      wears the same gorgeous and degrading livery with his retinue, and obtains
      only his share of the indifferent stare which we bestow upon them in
      common. The poems have no strong lights and shades, no background, no
      foreground;&mdash;they are like the illuminated figures in an oriental
      manuscript,&mdash;plenty of rich tints and no perspective. Such are the
      fruits of the most celebrated of these compositions. <span class="pagenum">93</span><a
      name="link93" id="link93"></a>Of those which are universally acknowledged
      to be bad it is scarcely possible to speak with patience. Yet they have
      much in common with their splendid companions. They differ from them, as a
      May-day procession of chimney-sweepers differs from the Field of Cloth of
      Gold. They have the gaudiness but not the wealth. His muse belongs to that
      numerous class of females who have no objection to be dirty, while they
      can be tawdry. When his brilliant conceits are exhausted, he supplies
      their place with metaphysical quibbles, forced antitheses, bad puns, and
      execrable charades. In his fifth sonnet he may, I think, be said to have
      sounded the lowest chasm of the Bathos. Upon the whole, that piece may be
      safely pronounced to be the worst attempt at poetry, and the worst attempt
      at wit, in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strong proof of the truth of these criticisms is, that almost all the
      sonnets produce exactly the same effect on the mind of the reader. They
      relate to all the various moods of a lover, from joy to despair:&mdash;yet
      they are perused, as far as my experience and observation have gone, with
      exactly the same feeling. The fact is, that in none of them are the
      passion and the ingenuity mixed in just proportions. There is not enough
      sentiment to dilute the condiments which are employed to season it. The
      repast which he sets before us resembles the Spanish entertainment in
      Dry-den&rsquo;s <i>Mock Astrologer</i>, at which the relish of all the dishes
      and sauces was overpowered by the common flavour of spice. Fish,&mdash;flesh,&mdash;fowl,&mdash;everything
      at table tasted of nothing but red pepper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writings of Petrarch may indeed suffer undeservedly from one cause to
      which I must allude. His imitators have so much familiarised the ear of
      Italy <span class="pagenum">94</span><a name="link94" id="link94"></a>and
      of Europe to the favourite topics of amorous flattery and lamentation,
      that we can scarcely think them original when we find them in the first
      author; and, even when our understandings have convinced us that they were
      new to him, they are still old to us. This has been the fate of many of
      the finest passages of the most eminent writers. It is melancholy to trace
      a noble thought from stage to stage of its profanation; to see it
      transferred from the first illustrious wearer to his lacqueys, turned, and
      turned again, and at last hung on a scare-crow. Petrarch has really
      suffered much from this cause. Yet that he should have so suffered is a
      sufficient proof that his excellences were not of the highest order. A
      line may be stolen; but the pervading spirit of a great poet is not to be
      sureptitiously obtained by a plagiarist. The continued imitation of
      twenty-five centuries has left Homer as it found him. If every simile and
      every turn of Dante had been copied ten thousand times, the Divine Comedy
      would have retained all its freshness. It was easy for the porter in
      Farquhar to pass for Beau Clincher, by borrowing his lace and his
      pulvilio. It would have been more difficult to enact Sir Harry Wildair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I quit this subject I must defend Petrarch from one accusation,
      which is in the present day frequently brought against him. His sonnets
      are pronounced by a large sect of critics not to possess certain qualities
      which they maintain to be indispensable to sonnets, with as much
      confidence, and as much reason, as their prototypes of old insisted on the
      unities of the drama. I am an exoteric&mdash;utterly unable to explain the
      mysteries of this new poetical faith. I only know that it is a faith,
      which except a man do keep pure and undefiled, without doubt he shall be
      called a <span class="pagenum">95</span><a name="link95" id="link95"></a>blockhead.
      I cannot, however, refrain from asking what is the particular virtue which
      belongs to fourteen as distinguished from all other numbers. Does it arise
      from its being a multiple of seven? Has this principle any reference to
      the sabbatical ordinance? Or is it to the order of rhymes that these
      singular properties are attached? Unhappily the sonnets of Shakspeare
      differ as much in this respect from those of Petrarch, as from a
      Spenserian or an octave stanza. Away with this unmeaning jargon! We have
      pulled down the old regime of criticism. I trust that we shall never
      tolerate the equally pedantic and irrational despotism, which some of the
      revolutionary leaders would erect upon its ruins. We have not dethroned
      Aristotle and Bossu for this.
    </p>
    <p>
      These sonnet-fanciers would do well to reflect that, though the style of
      Petrarch may not suit the standard of perfection which they have chosen,
      they lie under great obligations to these very poems,&mdash;that, but for
      Petrarch, the measure, concerning which they legislate so judiciously,
      would probably never have attracted notice;&mdash;and that to him they owe
      the pleasure of admiring, and the glory of composing, pieces, which seem
      to have been produced by Master Slender, with the assistance of his man
      Simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot conclude these remarks without making a few observations on the
      Latin writings of Petrarch. It appears that, both by himself and by his
      contemporaries, these were far more highly valued than his compositions in
      the vernacular language. Posterity, the supreme court of literary appeal,
      has not only reversed the judgment, but, according to its general
      practice, reversed it with costs, and condemned the unfortunate works to
      pay, not only for their own inferiority, but <span class="pagenum">96</span><a
      name="link96" id="link96"></a>also for the injustice of those who had
      given them an unmerited preference. And it must be owned that, without
      making large allowances for the circumstances under which they were
      produced, we cannot pronounce a very favourable judgment. They must be
      considered as exotics, transplanted to a foreign climate, and reared in an
      unfavourable situation; and it would be unreasonable to expect from them
      the health and the vigour which we find in the indigenous plants around
      them, or which they might themselves have possessed in their native soil.
      He has but very imperfectly imitated the style of the Latin authors, and
      has not compensated for the deficiency by enriching the ancient language
      with the graces of modern poetry. The splendour and ingenuity, which we
      admire, even when we condemn it, in his Italian works, is almost totally
      wanting, and only illuminates with rare and occasional glimpses the dreary
      obscurity of the Africa. The eclogues have more animation; but they can
      only be called poems by courtesy. They have nothing in common with his
      writings in his native language, except the eternal pun about Laura and
      Daphne. None of these works would have placed him on a level with Vida or
      Buchanan. Yet, when we compare him with those who preceded him, when we
      consider that he went on the forlorn hope of literature, that he was the
      first who perceived, and the first who attempted to revive, the finer
      elegancies of the ancient language of the world, we shall perhaps think
      more highly of him than of those who could never have surpassed his
      beauties if they had not inherited them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has aspired to emulate the philosophical eloquence of Cicero, as well
      as the poetical majesty of <span class="pagenum">97</span><a
      name="link97" id="link97"></a>Virgil. His essay on the Remedies of Good
      and Evil Fortune is a singular work, in a colloquial form, and a most
      scholastic style. It seems to be framed upon the model of the Tusculan
      Questions,&mdash;with what success those who have read it may easily
      determine. It consists of a series of dialogues: in each of these a person
      is introduced who has experienced some happy or some adverse event: he
      gravely states his case; and a reasoner, or rather Reason personified,
      confutes him; a task not very difficult, since the disciple defends his
      position only by pertinaciously repeating it, in almost the same words, at
      the end of every argument of his antagonist. In this manner Petrarch
      solves an immense variety of cases. Indeed, I doubt whether it would be
      possible to name any pleasure or any calamity which does not find a place
      in this dissertation. He gives excellent advice to a man who is in
      expectation of discovering the philosopher&rsquo;s stone;&mdash;to another, who
      has formed a fine aviary;&mdash;to a third, who is delighted with the
      tricks of a favourite monkey. His lectures to the unfortunate are equally
      singular. He seems to imagine that a precedent in point is a sufficient
      consolation for every form of suffering. &ldquo;Our town is taken,&rdquo; says one
      complainant;&rdquo; &ldquo;So was Troy,&rdquo; replies his comforter. &ldquo;My wife has eloped,&rdquo;
       says another; &ldquo;If it has happened to you once, it happened to Menelaus
      twice.&rdquo; One poor fellow is in great distress at having discovered that his
      wife&rsquo;s son is none of his. &ldquo;It is hard,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that I should have had
      the expense of bringing up one who is indifferent to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a man,&rdquo; returns his monitor, quoting the famous line of Terence;
      &ldquo;and nothing that belongs to any other man ought to be indifferent to
      you.&rdquo; The physical calamities of life are not omitted; <span
      class="pagenum">98</span><a name="link98" id="link98"></a>and there
      is in particular a disquisition on the advantages of having the itch,
      which, if not convincing, is certainly very amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invectives on an unfortunate physician, or rather upon the medical
      science, have more spirit. Petrarch was thoroughly in earnest on this
      subject. And the bitterness of his feelings occasionally produces, in the
      midst of his classical and scholastic pedantry, a sentence worthy of the
      second Philippic. Swift himself might have envied the chapter on the
      causes of the paleness of physicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of his Latin works the Epistles are the most generally known and admired.
      As compositions they are certainly superior to his essays. But their
      excellence is only comparative. From so large a collection of letters,
      written by so eminent a man, during so varied and eventful a life, we
      should have expected a complete and spirited view of the literature, the
      manners, and the politics of the age. A traveller&mdash;a poet&mdash;a
      scholar&mdash;a lover&mdash;a courtier&mdash;a recluse&mdash;he might have
      perpetuated, in an imperishable record, the form and pressure of the age
      and body of the time. Those who read his correspondence, in the hope of
      finding such information as this, will be utterly disappointed. It
      contains nothing characteristic of the period or of the individual. It is
      a series, not of letters, but of themes; and, as it is not generally
      known, might be very safely employed at public schools as a magazine of
      common-places. Whether he write on politics to the Emperor and the Doge,
      or send advice and consolation to a private friend, every line is crowded
      with examples and quotations, and sounds big with Anaxagoras and Scipio.
      Such was the interest excited by the character of Petrarch, and such the
      admiration <span class="pagenum">99</span><a name="link99" id="link99"></a>which
      was felt for his epistolary style, that it was with difficulty that his
      letters reached the place of their destination. The poet describes, with
      pretended regret and real complacency, the importunity of the curious, who
      often opened, and sometimes stole, these favourite compositions. It is a
      remarkable fact that, of all his epistles, the least affected are those
      which are addressed to the dead and the unborn. Nothing can be more absurd
      than his whim of composing grave letters of expostulation and commendation
      to Cicero and Seneca; yet these strange performances are written in a far
      more natural manner than his communications to his living correspondents.
      But of all his Latin works the preference must be given to the Epistle to
      Posterity; a simple, noble, and pathetic composition, most honourable both
      to his taste and his heart. If we can make allowance for some of the
      affected humility of an author, we shall perhaps think that no literary
      man has left a more pleasing memorial of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, we may pronounce that the works of Petrarch were below both
      his genius and his celebrity; and that the circumstances under which he
      wrote were as adverse to the development of his powers as they were
      favourable to the extension of his fame.

    <h2>
      SOME ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT LAWSUIT BETWEEN THE PARISHES OF ST. DENNIS AND
      ST. GEORGE IN THE WATER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">100</span><a name="link100" id="link100"></a>(<i>Knight&rsquo;s
      Quarterly Magazine</i>, April 1824.)
    </p>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The parish of St. Dennis is one of the most pleasant parts of the country
      in which it is situated. It is fertile, well wooded, well watered, and of
      an excellent air. For many generations the manor had been holden in
      tail-male by a worshipful family, who have always taken precedence of
      their neighbor&rsquo;s at the races and the sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ancient times the affairs of this parish were administered by a
      Court-Baron, in which the freeholders were judges; and the rates were
      levied by select vestries of the inhabitant householders. But at length
      these good customs fell into disuse. The Lords of the Manor, indeed, still
      held courts for form&rsquo;s sake; but they or their stewards had the whole
      management of affairs. They demanded services, duties, and customs to
      which they had no just title. Nay, they would often bring actions against
      their neighbours for their own private advantage, and then send in the
      bill to the parish. No objection was made, during many years, to these
      proceedings, so that the rates became heavier <span class="pagenum">101</span><a
      name="link101" id="link101"></a>and heavier: nor was any person exempted
      from these demands, except the footmen and gamekeepers of the squire and
      the rector of the parish. They indeed were never checked in any excess.
      They would come to an honest labourer&rsquo;s cottage, eat his pancakes, tuck
      his fowls into their pockets, and cane the poor man himself. If he went up
      to the great house to complain, it was hard to get the speech of Sir
      Lewis; and, indeed, his only chance of being righted was to coax the
      squire&rsquo;s pretty housekeeper, who could do what she pleased with her
      master. If he ventured to intrude upon the Lord of the Manor without this
      precaution, he gained nothing by his pains. Sir Lewis, indeed, would at
      first receive him with a civil face; for, to give him his due, he could be
      a fine gentleman when he pleased. &ldquo;Good day, my friend,&rdquo; he would say
      &ldquo;what situation have you in my family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless your honour!&rdquo; says the poor fellow, &ldquo;I am not one of your honour&rsquo;s
      servants; I rent a small piece of ground, your honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, you dog,&rdquo; quoth the squire, &ldquo;what do you mean by coming here? Has a
      gentleman nothing to do but to hear the complaints of clowns? Here!
      Philip, James, Dick, toss this fellow in a blanket; or duck him, and set
      him in the stocks to dry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of these precious Lords of the Manor enclosed a deer-park; and, in
      order to stock it, he seized all the pretty pet fawns that his tenants had
      brought up, without paying them a farthing, or asking their leave. It was
      a sad day for the parish of St. Dennis. Indeed, I do not believe that all
      his oppressive exactions and long bills enraged the poor tenants so much
      as this cruel measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet for a long time, in spite of all these inconveniences, <span
      class="pagenum">102</span><a name="link102" id="link102"></a>St.
      Dennis&rsquo;s was a very pleasant place. The people could not refrain from
      capering if they heard the sound of a fiddle. And, if they were inclined
      to be riotous, Sir Lewis had only to send for Punch, or the dancing dogs,
      and all was quiet again. But this could not last for ever; they began to
      think more and more of their condition; and, at last, a club of
      foulmouthed, good-for-nothing rascals was held at the sign of the Devil,
      for the purpose of abusing the squire and the parson. The doctor, to own
      the truth, was old and indolent, extremely fat and greedy. He had not
      preached a tolerable sermon for a long time. The squire was still worse:
      so that, partly by truth and partly by falsehood, the club set the whole
      parish against their superiors. The boys scrawled caricatures of the
      clergyman upon the church-door, and shot at the landlord with pop-guns as
      he rode a hunting. It was even whispered about that the Lord of the Manor
      had no right to his estate, and that, if he were compelled to produce the
      original title-deeds, it would be found that he only held the estate in
      trust for the inhabitants of the parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time the squire was pressed more and more for money. The
      parish could pay no more. The rector refused to lend a farthing. The Jews
      were clamorous for their money; and the landlord had no other resource
      than to call together the inhabitants of the parish, and to request their
      assistance. They now attacked him furiously about their grievances, and
      insisted that he should relinquish his oppressive powers. They insisted
      that his footmen should be kept in order, that the parson should pay his
      share of the rates, that the children of the parish should be allowed to
      fish in the trout-stream, and to gather blackberries in the <span
      class="pagenum">103</span><a name="link103" id="link103"></a>hedges.
      They at last went so far as to demand that he should acknowledge that he
      held his estate only in trust for them. His distress compelled him to
      submit. They, in return, agreed to set him free from his pecuniary
      difficulties, and to suffer him to inhabit the manor-house; and only
      annoyed him from time to time by singing impudent ballads under his
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbouring gentlefolks did not look on these proceedings with much
      complacency. It is true that Sir Lewis and his ancestors had plagued them
      with law-suits, and affronted them at county-meetings. Still they
      preferred the insolence of a gentleman to that of the rabble, and felt
      some uneasiness lest the example should infect their own tenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large party of them met at the house of Lord Cæsar Germain. Lord Cæsar
      was the proudest man in the country. His family was very ancient and
      illustrius ones, though not particularly opulent. He had invited most of
      his wealthy neighbours. There was Mrs. Kitty North, the relict of poor
      Squire Peter, respecting whom the coroner&rsquo;s jury had found a verdict of
      accidental death, but whose fate had nevertheless excited strange whispers
      in the neighbourhood. There was Squire Don, the owner of the great West
      Indian property, who was not so rich as he had formerly been, but still
      retained his pride, and kept up his customary pomp; so that he had plenty
      of plate but no breeches. There was Squire Von Blunderbussen, who had
      succeeded to the estates of his uncle, old Colonel Frederic Von
      Blunderbussen, of the hussar&rsquo;s. The colonel was a very singular old
      fellow; he used to learn a page of Chambaud&rsquo;s grammar, and to translate
      Telemaque, every morning, and he kept six French masters to teach him to
      parleyvoo. Nevertheless, he was a <span class="pagenum">104</span><a
      name="link104" id="link104"></a>shrewd clever man, and improved his estate
      with so much care, sometimes by honest and sometimes by dishonest means,
      that he left a very pretty property to his nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Cæsar poured out a glass of Tokay for Mrs. Kitty. &ldquo;Your health, my
      dear madam, I never saw you look more charming. Pray, what think you of
      these doings at St. Dennis&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine doings! indeed!&rdquo; interrupted Von Blunderbussen;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish that we had my old uncle alive, he would have had some of them up
      to the halberts. He knew how to use a cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails. If things go on
      in this way, a gentleman will not be able to horsewhip an impudent farmer,
      or to say a civil word to a milkmaid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, it&rsquo;s very true, Sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Kitty; &ldquo;their insolence is
      intolerable. Look at me, for instance:&mdash;a poor lone woman!&mdash;My
      dear Peter dead! I loved him:&mdash;so I did; and, when he died, I was so
      hysterical you cannot think. And now I cannot lean on the arm of a decent
      footman, or take a walk with a tall grenadier behind me, just to protect
      me from audacious vagabonds, but they must have their nauseous suspicions;&mdash;odious
      creatures!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This must be stopped,&rdquo; replied Lord Cæsar. &ldquo;We ought to contribute to
      support my poor brother-in-law against these rascals. I will write to
      Squire Guelf on this subject by this night&rsquo;s post. His name is always at
      the head of our county subscriptions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the people of St. Dennis&rsquo;s had been angry before, they were well nigh
      mad when they heard of this conversation. The whole parish ran to the
      manor-house. Sir Lewis&rsquo;s Swiss porter shut the door against them; but they
      broke in and knocked him on the head for his <span class="pagenum">105</span><a
      name="link105" id="link105"></a>impudence. They then seized the squire,
      hooted at him, pelted him, ducked him, and carried him to the watch-house.
      They turned the rector into the street, burnt his wig and band, and sold
      the church-plate by auction. They put up a painted Jezebel in the pulpit
      to preach. They scratched out the texts which were written round the
      church, and scribbled profane scraps of songs and plays in their place.
      They set the organ playing to pot-house tune. Instead of being decently
      asked in church, they were married over a broomstick. But, of all their
      whims, the use of the new patent steel-traps was the most remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      This trap was constructed on a completely new principle. It consisted of a
      cleaver hung in a frame like a window; when any poor wretch got in, down
      it came with a tremendous din, and took off his head in a twinkling. They
      got the squire into one of these machines. In order to prevent any of his
      partisans from getting footing in the parish, they placed traps at every
      corner. It was impossible to walk through the highway at broad noon
      without tumbling into one or other of them. No man could go about his
      business in security. Yet so great was the hatred which the inhabitants
      entertained for the old family, that a few decent honest people, who
      begged them to take down the steel-traps, and to put up humane man-traps
      in their room, were very roughly handled for their good nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time the neighbouring gentry undertook a suit against the
      parish on the behalf of Sir Lewis&rsquo;s heir, and applied to Squire Guelf for
      his assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody knows that Squire Guelf is more closely tied up than any
      gentleman in the shire. He could, therefore, lend them no help; but he
      referred them to <span class="pagenum">106</span><a name="link106"
       id="link106"></a>the Vestry of the Parish of St. George in the Water.
      These good people had long borne a grudge against their neighbours on the
      other side of the stream; and some mutual trespasses had lately occurred
      which increased their hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an honest Irishman, a great favourite among them, who used to
      entertain them with raree-shows, and to exhibit a magic lantern to the
      children on winter evenings. He had gone quite mad upon this subject.
      Sometimes he would call out in the middle of the street&mdash;&ldquo;Take care
      of that corner, neighbours; for the love of Heaven, keep clear of that
      post, there is a patent steel-trap concealed thereabouts.&rdquo; Sometimes he
      would be disturbed by frightful dreams; then he would get up at dead of
      night, open his window and cry &ldquo;fire,&rdquo; till the parish was roused, and the
      engines sent for. The pulpit of the Parish of St. George seemed likely to
      fall; I believe that the only reason was that the parson had grown too fat
      and heavy; but nothing would persuade this honest man but that it was a
      scheme of the people at St. Dennis&rsquo;s, and that they had sawed through the
      pillars in order to break the rector&rsquo;s neck. Once he went about with a
      knife in his pocket, and told all the persons whom he met that it had been
      sharpened by the knife-grinder of the next parish to cut their throats.
      These extravagancies had a great effect on the people; and the more so
      because they were espoused by Squire Guelf&rsquo;s steward, who was the most
      influential person in the parish. He was a very fair-spoken man, very
      attentive to the main chance, and the idol of the old women, because he
      never played at skittles or danced with the girls; and, indeed, never took
      any recreation but that of drinking on Saturday nights with his friend
      Harry, the Scotch <span class="pagenum">107</span><a name="link107"
       id="link107"></a>pedlar. His supporters called him Sweet William; his
      enemies the Bottomless Pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people of St. Dennis&rsquo;s, however, had their advocates. There was Frank,
      the richest farmer in the parish, whose great grandfather had been knocked
      oil the head many years before, in a squabble between the parish and a
      former landlord. There was Dick, the merry-andrew, rather light-fingered
      and riotous, but a clever droll fellow. Above all, there was Charley, the
      publican, a jolly, fat, honest lad, a great favourite with the women, who,
      if he had not been rather too fond of ale and chuck-farthing, would have
      been the best fellow in the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boys,&rdquo; said Charley, &ldquo;this is exceedingly well for Madam North;&mdash;not
      that I would speak uncivilly of her; she put up my picture in her best
      room, bless her for it! But, I say, this is very well for her, and for
      Lord Cæsar, and Squire Don, and Colonel Von;&mdash;but what affair is it
      of yours or mine? It is not to be wondered at, that gentlemen should wish
      to keep poor people out of their own. But it is strange, indeed, that they
      should expect the poor themselves to combine against their own interests.
      If the folks at St. Dennis&rsquo;s should attack us we have the law and our
      cudgels to protect us. But why, in the name of wonder, are we to attack
      them? When old Sir Charles, who was Lord of the Manor formerly, and the
      parson, who was presented by him to the living, tried to bully the vestry,
      did not we knock their heads together, and go to meeting to hear Jeremiah
      Ringletub preach? And did the Squire Don, or the great Sir Lewis, that
      lived at that time, or the Germains, say a word against us for it? Mind
      your own business, my lads: law is not to <span class="pagenum">108</span><a
      name="link108" id="link108"></a>be had for nothing; and we, you may be
      sure, shall have to pay the whole bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless the people of St. George&rsquo;s were resolved on law. They cried
      out most lustily, &ldquo;Squire Guelf for ever! Sweet William for ever! No steel
      traps!&rdquo; Squire Guelf took all the rascally footmen who had worn old Sir
      Lewis&rsquo;s livery into his service. They were fed in the kitchen on the very
      best of every thing, though they had no settlement. Many people, and the
      paupers in particular, grumbled at these proceedings. The steward,
      however, devised a way to keep them quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had lived in this parish for many years an old gentleman, named Sir
      Habeas Corpus. He was said by some to be of Saxon, by some of Norman,
      extraction. Some maintained that he was not born till after the time of
      Sir Charles, to whom we have before alluded. Others are of opinion that he
      was a legitimate son of old Lady Magna Charta, although he was long
      concealed and kept out of his birthright. Certain it is that he was a very
      benevolent person. Whenever any poor fellow was taken up on grounds which
      he thought insufficient, he used to attend on his behalf and bail him; and
      thus he had become so popular, that to take direct measures against him
      was out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward, accordingly, brought a dozen physicians to examine Sir
      Habeas. After consultation, they reported that he was in a very bad way,
      and ought not, on any account, to be allowed to stir out for several
      months. Fortified with this authority, the parish officers put him to bed,
      closed his windows, and barred his doors. They paid him every attention,
      and from <span class="pagenum">109</span><a name="link109"
       id="link109"></a>time to time issued bulletins of his health. The steward
      never spoke of him without declaring that he was the best gentleman in the
      world; but excellent care was taken that he should never stir out of
      doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this obstacle was removed, the Squire and the steward kept the parish
      in excellent order; flogged this man, sent that man to the stocks, and
      pushed forward the law-suit with a noble disregard of expense. They were,
      however, wanting either in skill or in fortune. And every thing went
      against them after their antagonists had begun to employ Solicitor Nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who does not know the name of Solicitor Nap? At what alehouse is not his
      behaviour discussed? In what print-shop is not his picture seen? Yet how
      little truth has been said about him! Some people hold that he used to
      give laudanum by pints to his sick clerks for his amusement. Others, whose
      number has very much increased since he was killed by the gaol distemper,
      conceive that he was the very model of honour and good-nature. I shall try
      to tell the truth about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was assuredly an excellent solicitor. In his way he never was
      surpassed. As soon as the parish began to employ him, their cause took a
      turn. In a very little time they were successful; and Nap became rich. He
      now set up for a gentleman; took possession of the old manor-house; got
      into the commission of the peace, and affected to be on a par with the
      best of the county. He governed the vestries as absolutely as the old
      family had done. Yet, to give him his due, he managed things with far more
      discretion than either Sir Lewis or the rioters who had pulled the Lords
      of the Manor down. He kept his servants in tolerable order. He <span
      class="pagenum">110</span><a name="link110" id="link110"></a>removed
      the steel traps from the highways and the corners of the streets. He still
      left a few indeed In the more exposed parts of his premises; and set up a
      board announcing that traps and spring guns were set in his grounds. He
      brought the poor parson hack to the parish; and, though he did not enable
      him to keep a fine house and a coach as formerly, he settled him in a snug
      little cottage, and allowed him a pleasant pad-nag. He whitewashed the
      church again; and put the stocks, which had been much wanted of late, into
      good repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the neighbouring gentry, however, he was no favourite. He was crafty
      and litigious. He cared nothing for right, if he could raise a point of
      law against them. He pounded their cattle, broke their hedges, and seduced
      their tenants from them. He almost ruined Lord Caesar with actions, in
      every one of which he was successful. Von Blunderbussen went to law with
      him for an alleged trespass, but was cast, and almost ruined by the costs
      of suit. He next took a fancy to the seat of Squire Don, who was, to say
      the truth, little better than an idiot. He asked the poor dupe to dinner,
      and then threatened to have him tossed in a blanket unless he would make
      over his estates to him. The poor Squire signed and sealed a deed by which
      the property was assigned to Joe, a brother of Nap&rsquo;s, in trust for and to
      the use of Nap himself. The tenants, however, stood out. They maintained
      that the estate was entailed, and refused to pay rents to the new
      landlord; and in this refusal they were stoutly supported by the people in
      St. George&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the same time Nap took it into his head to match with quality, and
      nothing would serve him but one of the Miss Germains. Lord Cæsar swore
      like <span class="pagenum">111</span><a name="link111" id="link111"></a>a
      trooper; but there was no help for it. Nap had twice put executions in his
      principal residence, and had refused to discharge the latter of the two,
      till he had extorted a bond from his Lordship, which compelled him to
      comply.

      A CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR. ABRAHAM COWLEY AND MR. JOHN MILTON, TOUCHING

      <br /> <span class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span><br />
      have thought it good to set down in writing a memorable debate, wherein I
      was a listener, and two men of pregnant parts and great reputation
      discoursers; hoping that my friends will not be displeased to have a
      record both of the strange times through which I have lived, and of the
      famous men with whom I have conversed. It chanced, in the warm and
      beautiful spring of the year 1665, a little before the saddest summer that
      ever London saw, that I went to the Bowling-Green at Piccadilly, whither,
      at that time, the best gentry made continual resort. There I met Mr.
      Cowley, who had lately left Barnelms. There was then a house preparing for
      him at Chertsey; and, till it should be finished, he had come up for a
      short time to London, that he might urge a suit to his Grace of Buckingham
      touching certain lands of her Majesty&rsquo;s, whereof he requested a lease. I
      had the honour to be familiarly acquainted with that worthy gentleman
      <span class="pagenum">113</span><a name="link113" id="link113"></a>and
      most excellent poet, whose death hath been deplored with as general a
      consent of all Powers that delight in the woods, or in verse, or in love,
      as was of old that of Daphnis or of Gallus. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      After some talk, which it is not material to set down at large, concerning
      his suit and his vexations at the court, where indeed his honesty did him
      more harm than his parts could do him good, I entreated him to dine with
      me at my lodging in the Temple, which he most courteously promised. And,
      that so eminent a guest might not lack a better entertainment than cooks
      or vintners can provide, I sent to the house of Mr. John Milton, in the
      Artillery-Walk, to beg that he would also be my guest. For, though he had
      been secretary, first to the Council of State, and, after that, to the
      Protector, and Mr. Cowley had held the same post under the Lord St. Albans
      in his banishment, I hoped, notwithstanding, that they would think
      themselves rather united by their common art than divided by their
      different factions. And so indeed it proved. For, while we sat at table,
      they talked freely of many men and things, as well ancient as modern, with
      much civility. Nay, Mr. Milton, who seldom tasted wine, both because of
      his singular temperance and because of his gout, did more than once
      pledge. Mr. Cowley, who was indeed no hermit in diet. At last, being
      heated, Mr. Milton begged that I would open the windows. &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said I,
      &ldquo;if you desire fresh air and coolness, what should hinder us, as the
      evening is fair, from sailing for an hour on the river?&rdquo; To this they both
      cheerfully consented; and forth we walked, Mr. Cowley and I leading Mr.
      Milton between us, to the Temple Stairs. There we took a boat; and thence
      we were rowed up the river. <span class="pagenum">114</span><a
      name="link114" id="link114"></a>The wind was pleasant; the evening fine;
      the sky, the earth, and the water beautiful to look Upon. But Mr. Cowley
      and I held our peace, and said nothing of the gay sights around us, lest
      we should too feelingly remind Mr. Milton of his calamity; whereof,
      however, he needed no monitor: for soon he said sadly, &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Cowley,
      you are a happy man. What would I now give but for one more look at the
      sun, and the waters, and the gardens of this fair city!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said Mr. Cowley, &ldquo;whether we ought not rather to envy you
      for that which makes you to envy others: and that specially in this place,
      where all eyes which are not closed in blindness ought to become fountains
      of tears. What can we look upon which is not a memorial of change and
      sorrow, of fair things vanished, and evil things done? When I see the gate
      of Whitehall, and the stately pillars of the Banqueting House, I cannot
      choose but think of what I have there seen in former days, masques, and
      pageants, and dances, and smiles, and the waving of graceful heads, and
      the bounding of delicate feet. And then I turn to thoughts of other
      things, which even to remember makes me to blush and weep;&mdash;of the
      great black scaffold, and the axe and block, which were placed before
      those very windows; and the voice seems to sound in mine ears, the lawless
      and terrible voice, which cried out that the head of a king was the head
      of a traitor. There stands Westminster Hall, which who can look upon, and
      not tremble to think how time, and change, and death confound the councils
      of the wise, and beat down the weapons of the mighty? How have I seen it
      surrounded with tens of thousands of petitioners crying for justice and
      privilege! How have I heard it shake <span class="pagenum">115</span><a
      name="link115" id="link115"></a>with fierce and proud words, which made
      the hearts of the people burn within them! Then it is blockaded by
      dragoons, and cleared by pikemen. And they who have conquered their master
      go forth trembling at the word of their servant. And yet a little while,
      and the usurper comes forth from it, in his robe of ermine, with the
      golden staff in one hand and the Bible in the other, amidst the roaring of
      the guns and the shouting of the people. And yet again a little while, and
      the doors are thronged with multitudes in black, and the hearse and the
      plumes come forth; and the tyrant is borne, in more than royal pomp, to a
      royal sepulchre. A few days more, and his head is fixed to rot on the
      pinnacles of that very hall where he sat on a throne in his life, and lay
      in state after his death. When I think on all these things, to look round
      me makes me sad at heart. True it is that God hath restored to us our old
      laws, and the rightful line of our kings. Yet, how I know not, but it
      seems to me that something is wanting&mdash;that our court hath not the
      old gravity, nor our people the old loyalty. These evil times, like the
      great deluge, have overwhelmed and confused all earthly things. And, even
      as those waters, though at last they abated, yet, as the learned write,
      destroyed all trace of the garden of Eden, so that its place hath never
      since been found, so hath this opening of all the flood-gates of political
      evil effaced all marks of the ancient political paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, by your favour,&rdquo; said Mr. Milton, &ldquo;though, from many circumstances
      both of body and of fortune, I might plead fairer excuses for despondency
      than yourself, I yet look not so sadly either on the past or on the
      future. That a deluge hath passed over this our nation, I deny not. But I
      hold it not to be <span class="pagenum">116</span><a name="link116"
       id="link116"></a>such a deluge as that of which you speak; but rather a
      blessed flood, like those of the Nile, which in its overflow doth indeed
      wash away ancient landmarks, and confound boundaries, and sweep away
      dwellings, yea, doth give birth to many foul and dangerous reptiles. Yet
      hence is the fulness of the granary, the beauty of the garden, the nurture
      of all living things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember well, Mr. Cowley, what you have said concerning these things
      in your Discourse of the Government of Oliver Cromwell, which my friend
      Elwood read to me last year. Truly, for elegance and rhetoric, that essay
      is to be compared with the finest tractates of Isocrates and Cicero. But
      neither that nor any other book, nor any events, which with most men have,
      more than any book, weight and authority, have altered my opinion, that,
      of all assemblies that ever were in this world, the best and the most
      useful was our Long Parliament. I speak not this as wishing to provoke
      debate; which neither yet do I decline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cowley was, as I could see, a little nettled. Yet, as he was a man of
      a kind disposition and a most refined courtesy, he put a force upon
      himself, and answered with more vehemence and quickness indeed than was
      his wont, yet not uncivilly. &ldquo;Surely, Mr. Milton, you speak not as you
      think. I am indeed one of those who believe that God hath reserved to
      himself the censure of kings, and that their crimes and oppressions are
      not to be resisted by the hands of their subjects. Yet can I easily find
      excuse for the violence of such as are stung to madness by grievous
      tyranny. But what shall we say for these men? Which of their just demands
      was not granted? Which even of their cruel and unreasonable requisitions,
      so as it <span class="pagenum">117</span><a name="link117"
       id="link117"></a>were not inconsistent with all law and order, was
      refused? Had they not sent Strafford to the block and Laud to the Tower?
      Had they not destroyed the Courts of the High Commission and the Star
      Chamber? Had they not reversed the proceedings confirmed by the voices of
      the judges of England, in the matter of ship-money? Had they not taken
      from the king his ancient and most lawful power touching the order of
      knighthood? Had they not provided that, after their dissolution, triennial
      parliaments should be holden, and that their own power should continue
      till of their great condescension they should be pleased to resign it
      themselves? What more could they ask? Was it not enough that they had
      taken from their king all his oppressive powers, and many that were most
      salutary? Was it not enough that they had filled his council-board with
      his enemies, and his prisons with his adherents? Was it not enough that
      they had raised a furious multitude, to shout and swagger daily under the
      very windows of his royal palace? Was it not enough that they had taken
      from him the most blessed prerogative of princely mercy; that, complaining
      of intolerance themselves, they had denied all toleration to others; that
      they had urged, against forms, scruples childish as those of any
      formalist; that they had persecuted the least remnant of the popish rites
      with the fiercest bitterness of the popish spirit? Must they besides all
      this have full power to command his armies, and to massacre his friends?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For military command, it was never known in any monarchy, nay, in any
      well ordered republic, that it was committed to the debates of a large and
      unsettled assembly. For their other requisition, that he should give up to
      their vengeance all who had defended the <span class="pagenum">118</span><a
      name="link118" id="link118"></a>rights of his crown, his honour must have
      been ruined if he had complied. Is it not therefore plain that they
      desired these things only in order that, by refusing, his Majesty might
      give them a pretence for war?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men have often risen up against fraud, against cruelty, against rapine.
      But when before was it known that concessions were met with importunities,
      graciousness with insults, the open palm of bounty with the clenched fist
      of malice? Was it like trusty delegates of the Commons of England, and
      faithful stewards of their liberty and their wealth, to engage them for
      such causes in civil war, which both to liberty and to wealth is of all
      things the most hostile. Evil indeed must be the disease which is not more
      tolerable than such a medicine. Those who, even to save a nation from
      tyrants, excite it to civil war do in general but minister to it the same
      miserable kind of relief wherewith the wizards of Pharaoh mocked the
      Egyptian. We read that, when Moses had turned their waters into blood,
      those impious magicians, intending, not benefit to the thirsting people,
      but vain and emulous ostentation of their own art, did themselves also
      change into blood the water which the plague had spared. Such sad comfort
      do those who stir up war minister to the oppressed. But here where was the
      oppression? What was the favour which had not been granted? What was the
      evil which had not been removed? What further could they desire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These questions,&rdquo; said Mr. Milton, austerely, &ldquo;have indeed often deceived
      the ignorant; but that Mr. Cowley should have been so beguiled, I marvel.
      You ask what more the Parliament could desire? I will answer you in one
      word, security. What are votes, and statutes, and resolutions? They have
      no <span class="pagenum">119</span><a name="link119" id="link119"></a>eyes
      to see, no hands to strike and avenge. They must have some safeguard from
      without. Many things, therefore, which in themselves were peradventure
      hurtful, was this Parliament constrained to ask, lest otherwise good laws
      and precious rights should be without defence. Nor did they want a great
      and signal example of this danger. I need not remind you that, many years
      before, the two Houses had presented to the king the Petition of Right,
      wherein were set down all the most valuable privileges of the people of
      this realm. Did not Charles accept it? Did he not declare it to be law?
      Was it not as fully enacted as ever were any of those bills of the Long
      Parliament concerning which you spoke? And were those privileges therefore
      enjoyed more fully by the people? No: the king did from that time redouble
      his oppressions as if to avenge himself for the shame of having been
      compelled to renounce them. Then were our estates laid under shameful
      impositions, our houses ransacked, our bodies imprisoned. Then was the
      steel of the hangman blunted with mangling the ears of harmless men. Then
      our very minds were fettered, and the iron entered into our souls. Then we
      mere compelled to hide our hatred, our sorrow, and our scorn, to laugh
      with hidden faces at the mummery of Laud, to curse under our breath the
      tyranny of Wentworth. Of old time it was well and nobly said, by one of
      our kings, that an Englishman ought to be free as his thoughts. Our prince
      reversed the maxim; he strove to make our thoughts as much slaves as
      ourselves. To sneer at a Romish pageant, to miscall a lord&rsquo;s crest, were
      crimes for which there was no mercy. These were all the fruits which we
      gathered from those excellent laws of the former Parliament, from these
      solemn promises of <span class="pagenum">120</span><a name="link120"
       id="link120"></a>the king. Were we to be deceived again? Were we again to
      give subsidies, and receive nothing but promises? Were we again to make
      wholesome statutes, and then leave them to be broken daily and hourly,
      until the oppressor should have squandered another supply, and should be
      ready for another perjury? You ask what they could desire which he had not
      already granted. Let me ask of you another question. What pledge could he
      give which he had not already violated? From the first year of his reign,
      whenever he had need of the purses of his Commons to support the revels of
      Buckingham or the processions of Laud, he had assured them that, as he was
      a gentleman and a king, he would sacredly preserve their rights. He had
      pawned those solemn pledges, and pawned them again and again; but when had
      he redeemed them? &lsquo;Upon my faith,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Upon my sacred word,&rsquo;&mdash;Upon
      the honour of a prince,&rsquo;&mdash;came so easily from his lips, and dwelt so
      short a time on his mind, that they were as little to be trusted as the
      &lsquo;By these hilts&rsquo; of an Alsatian dicer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore it is that I praise this Parliament for what else I might have
      condemned. If what he had granted had been granted graciously and readily,
      if what he had before promised had been faithfully observed, they could
      not be defended. It was because he had never yielded the worst abuse
      without a long struggle, and seldom without a large bribe: it was because
      he had no sooner disentangled himself from his troubles than he forgot his
      promises; and, more like a villainous huckster than a great king, kept
      both the prerogative and the large price which had been paid to him to
      forego it; it was because of these things that it was necessary and just
      to bind with forcible restraints <span class="pagenum">121</span><a
      name="link121" id="link121"></a>one who could be bound neither by law nor
      honour. Nay, even while he was making those very concessions of which you
      speak, he betrayed his deadly hatred against the people and their friends.
      Not only did he, contrary to all that ever was deemed lawful in England,
      order that members of the Commons House of Parliament should be impeached
      of high treason at the bar of the Lords; thereby violating both the trial
      by jury and the privileges of the House; but, not content with breaking
      the law by his ministers, he went himself armed to assail it. In the
      birth-place and sanctuary of freedom, in the House itself, nay, in the
      very chair of the speaker, placed for the protection of free speech and
      privilege, he sat, rolling his eyes round the benches, searching for those
      whose blood he desired, and singling out his opposers to the slaughter.
      This most foul outrage fails. Then again for the old arts. Then come
      gracious messages. Then come courteous speeches. Then is again mortgaged
      his often forfeited honour. He will never again violate the laws. He will
      respect their rights as if they were his own. He pledges the dignity of
      his crown; that crown which had been committed to him for the weal of his
      people, and which he never named, but that he might the more easily delude
      and oppress them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The power of the sword, I grant you, was not one to be permanently
      possessed by parliament. Neither did that parliament demand it as a
      permanent possession. They asked it only for temporary security. Nor can I
      see on what conditions they could safely make peace with that false and
      wicked king, save such as would deprive him of all power to injure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For civil war, that it is an evil I dispute not. But that it is the
      greatest of evils, that I stoutly deny. It <span class="pagenum">122</span><a
      name="link122" id="link122"></a>doth indeed appear to the misjudging to be
      a worse calamity than bad government, because its miseries are collected
      together within a short space and time, and may easily at one view be
      taken in and perceived. But the misfortunes of nations ruled by tyrants,
      being distributed over many centuries and many places, as they are of
      greater weight and number, so are they of less display. When the Devil of
      tyranny hath gone into the body politic he departs not but with struggles,
      and foaming, and great convulsions. Shall he, therefore, vex it for ever,
      lest, in going out, he for a moment tear and rend it? Truly this argument
      touching the evils of war would better become my friend Elwood, or some
      other of the people called Quakers, than a courtier and a cavalier. It
      applies no more to this war than to all others, as well foreign as
      domestic, and, in this war, no more to the Houses than to the king; nay
      not so much, since he by a little sincerity and moderation might have
      rendered that needless which their duty to God and man then enforced them
      to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Mr. Milton,&rdquo; said Mr. Cowley; &ldquo;I grieve to hear you speak thus
      of that good king. Most unhappy indeed he was, in that he reigned at a
      time when the spirit of the then living generation was for freedom, and
      the precedents of former ages for prerogative. His case was like to that
      of Christopher Columbus, when he sailed forth on an unknown ocean, and
      found that the compass, whereby he shaped his course, had shifted from the
      north pole whereto before it had constantly pointed. So it was with
      Charles. His compass varied; and therefore he could not tack aright. If he
      had been an absolute king he would doubtless, like Titus Vespasian, have
      been called the <span class="pagenum">123</span><a name="link123"
       id="link123"></a>delight of the human race. If he had been a Doge of
      Venice, or a Stadtholder of Holland, he would never have outstepped the
      laws. But he lived when our government had neither clear definitions nor
      strong sanctions. Let, therefore, his faults be ascribed to the time. Of
      his virtues the praise is his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never was there a more gracious prince, or a more proper gentleman. In
      every pleasure he was temperate, in conversation mild and grave, in
      friendship constant, to his servants liberal, to his queen faithful and
      loving, in battle brave, in sorrow and captivity resolved, in death most
      Christian and forgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For his oppressions, let us look at the former history of this realm.
      James was never accounted a tyrant. Elizabeth is esteemed to have been the
      mother of her people. Were they less arbitrary? Did they never lay hands
      on the purses of their subjects but by Act of Parliament? Did they never
      confine insolent and disobedient men but in due course of law? Was the
      court of Star Chamber less active? Were the ears of libellers more safe? I
      pray you, let not king Charles be thus dealt with. It was enough that in
      his life he was tried for an alleged breach of laws which none ever heard
      named till they were discovered for his destruction. Let not his fame be
      treated as was his sacred and anointed body. Let not his memory be tried
      by principles found out <i>ex post facto</i>. Let us not judge by the
      spirit of one generation a man whose disposition had been formed by the
      temper and fashion of another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but conceive me, Mr. Cowley,&rdquo; said Mr. Milton; &ldquo;inasmuch as, at the
      beginning of his reign, he imitated those who had governed before him, I
      blame him not. To expect that kings will, of their <span class="pagenum">124</span><a
      name="link124" id="link124"></a>own free choice, abridge their
      prerogative, were argument of but slender wisdom. Whatever, therefore,
      lawless, unjust, or cruel, he either did or permitted during the first
      years of his reign, I pass by. But for what was done after that he had
      solemnly given his consent to the Petition of Right, where shall we find
      defence? Let it be supposed, which yet I concede not, that the tyranny of
      his father and of Queen Elizabeth had been no less rigorous than was his.
      But had his father, had that queen, sworn, like him, to abstain from those
      rigours. Had they, like him, for good and valuable consideration, aliened
      their hurtful prerogatives? Surely not: from whatever excuse you can plead
      for him he had wholly excluded himself. The borders of countries, we know,
      are mostly the seats of perpetual wars and tumults. It was the same with
      the undefined frontiers, which of old separated privilege and prerogative.
      They were the debatable land of our polity. It was no marvel if, both on
      the one side and on the other, inroads were often made. But, when treaties
      have been concluded, spaces measured, lines drawn, landmarks set up, that
      which before might pass for innocent error or just reprisal becomes
      robbery, perjury, deadly sin. He knew not, you say, which of his powers
      were founded on ancient law, and which only on vicious example. But had he
      not read the Petition of Right? Had not proclamation been made from his
      throne; <i>Soit fait comme il est desiré?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For his private virtues they are beside the question. Remember you not,&rdquo;
       and Mr. Milton smiled, but somewhat sternly, &ldquo;what Dr. Caius saith in the
      Merry Wives of Shakspeare? &lsquo;What shall the honest man do in my closet?
      There is no honest man that shall come in my closet.&rsquo; Even so say I. There
      is no good <span class="pagenum">125</span><a name="link125"
       id="link125"></a>man who shall make us his slaves. If he break his word to
      his people, is it a sufficient defence that he keeps it to his companions?
      If he oppress and extort all day, shall he be held blameless because he
      prayeth at night and morning? If he be insatiable in plunder and revenge,
      shall we pass it by because in meat and drink he is temperate? If he have
      lived like a tyrant, shall all be forgotten because he hath died like a
      martyr?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a man, as I think, who had so much semblance of virtues as might
      make his vices most dangerous. He was not a tyrant after our wonted
      English model. The second Richard, the second and fourth Edwards, and the
      eighth Harry, were men profuse, gay, boisterous; lovers of women and of
      wine, of no outward sanctity or gravity. Charles was a ruler after the
      Italian fashion; grave, demure, of a solemn carriage, and a sober diet; as
      constant at prayers as a priest, as heedless of oaths as an atheist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cowley answered somewhat sharply: &ldquo;I am sorry, Sir, to hear you speak
      thus. I had hoped that the vehemence of spirit which was caused by these
      violent times had now abated. Yet, sure, Mr. Milton, whatever you may
      think of the character of King Charles, you will not still justify his
      murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Milton, &ldquo;I must have been of a hard and strange nature, if
      the vehemence which was imputed to me in my younger days had not been
      diminished by the afflictions wherewith it hath pleased Almighty God to
      chasten my age. I will not now defend all that I may heretofore have
      written. But this I say, that I perceive not wherefore a king should be
      exempted from all punishment. Is it just that where most is given least
      should be required? Or <span class="pagenum">126</span><a
      name="link126" id="link126"></a>politic that where there is the greatest
      power to injure there should be no danger to restrain? But, you will say,
      there is no such law. Such a law there is. There is the law of
      self-preservation written by God himself on our hearts. There is the
      primal compact and bond of society, not graven on stone, nor sealed with
      wax, nor put down on parchment, nor set forth in any express form of words
      by men when of old they came together; but implied in the very act that
      they so came together, pre-supposed in all subsequent law, not to be
      repealed by any authority, not invalidated by being omitted in any code;
      inasmuch as from thence are all codes and all authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I well see wherefore you cavaliers, and, indeed, many of us
      whom you merrily call Roundheads, distinguish between those who fought
      against King Charles, and specially after the second commission given to
      Sir Thomas Fairfax, and those who condemned him to death. Sure, if his
      person were inviolable, it was as wicked to lift the sword against it at
      Naseby as the axe at Whitehall. If his life might justly be taken, why not
      in course of trial as well as by right of war?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus much in general as touching the right. But, for the execution of
      King Charles in particular, I will not now undertake to defend it. Death
      is inflicted, not that the culprit may die, but that the state may be
      thereby advantaged. And, from all that I know, I think that the death of
      King Charles hath more hindered than advanced the liberties of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, he left an heir. He was in captivity. The heir was in freedom. He
      was odious to the Scots. The heir was favoured by them. To kill the
      captive therefore, whereby the heir, in the apprehension of all <span
      class="pagenum">127</span><a name="link127" id="link127"></a>royalists,
      became forthwith king&mdash;what was it, in truth, but to set their
      captive free, and to give him besides other great advantages?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next, it was a deed most odious to the people, and not only to your
      party, but to many among ourselves; and, as it is perilous for any
      government to outrage the public opinion, so most was it perilous for a
      government which had from that opinion alone its birth, its nurture, and
      its defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet doth not this properly belong to our dispute; nor can these faults be
      justly charged upon that most renowned parliament. For, as you know, the
      high court of justice was not established until the house had been purged
      of such members as were adverse to the army, and brought wholly under the
      control of the chief officers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who,&rdquo; said Mr. Cowley, &ldquo;levied that army? Who commissioned those
      officers? Was not the fate of the Commons as justly deserved as was that
      of Diomedes, who was devoured by those horses whom he had himself taught
      to feed on the flesh and blood of men? How could they hope that others
      would respect laws which they had themselves insulted; that swords which
      had been drawn against the prerogatives of the king would be put up at an
      ordinance of the Commons? It was believed, of old, that there were some
      devils easily raised but never to be laid; insomuch that, if a magician
      called them up, he should be forced to find them always some employment;
      for, though they would do all his bidding, yet, if he left them but for
      one moment without some work of evil to perform, they would turn their
      claws against himself. Such a fiend is an army. They who evoke it cannot
      dismiss it. They are at once its masters and its slaves. Let <span
      class="pagenum">128</span><a name="link128" id="link128"></a>them not
      fail to find for it task after task of blood and rapine. Let them not
      leave it for a moment in repose, lest it tear them in pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus was it with that famous assembly. They formed a force which they
      could neither govern nor resist. They made it powerful. They made it
      fanatical. As if military insolence were not of itself sufficiently
      dangerous, they heightened it with spiritual pride,&mdash;they encouraged
      their soldiers to rave from the tops of tubs against the men of Belial,
      till every trooper thought himself a prophet. They taught them to abuse
      popery, till every drummer fancied that he was as infallible as a pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was that religion changed her nature. She was no longer the
      parent of arts and letters, of wholesome knowledge, of innocent pleasures,
      of blessed household smiles. In their place came sour faces, whining
      voices, the chattering of fools, the yells of madmen. Then men fasted from
      meat and drink, who fasted not from bribes and blood. Then men frowned at
      stage-plays, who smiled at massacres. Then men preached against painted
      faces, who felt no remorse for their own most painted lives. Religion had
      been a pole-star to light and to guide. It was now more like to that
      ominous star in the book of the Apocalypse, which fell from heaven upon
      the fountains and rivers and changed them into wormwood; for even so did
      it descend from its high and celestial dwelling-place to plague this
      earth, and to turn into bitterness all that was sweet, and into poison all
      that was nourishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore it was not strange that such things should follow. They who had
      closed the barriers of London against the king could not defend them
      against their own creatures. They who had so stoutly cried <span
      class="pagenum">129</span><a name="link129" id="link129"></a>for
      privilege, when that prince, most unadvisedly no doubt, came among them to
      demand their members, durst not wag their fingers when Oliver filled their
      hall with soldiers, gave their mace to a corporal, put their keys in his
      pocket, and drove them forth with base terms, borrowed half from the
      conventicle and half from the ale-house. Then were we, like the trees of
      the forest in holy writ, given over to the rule of the bramble; then from
      the basest of the shrubs came forth the fire which devoured the cedars of
      Lebanon. We bowed down before a man of mean birth, of ungraceful
      demeanour, of stammering and most vulgar utterance, of scandalous and
      notorious hypocrisy. Our laws were made and unmade at his pleasure; the
      constitution of our parliaments changed by his writ and proclamation; our
      persons imprisoned; our property plundered; our lands and houses overrun
      with soldiers; and the great charter itself was but argument for a
      scurrilous jest; and for all this we may thank that parliament: for never,
      unless they had so violently shaken the vessel, could such foul dregs have
      risen to the top.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then answered Mr. Milton: &ldquo;What you have now said comprehends so great a
      number of subjects, that it would require, not an evening&rsquo;s sail on the
      Thames, but rather a voyage to the Indies, accurately to treat of all:
      yet, in as few words as I may, I will explain my sense of these matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, as to the army. An army, as you have well set forth, is always a
      weapon dangerous to those who use it; yet he who falls among thieves
      spares not to fire his musquetoon, because he may be slain if it burst in
      his hand. Nor must states refrain from defending themselves, lest their
      defenders should at last turn <span class="pagenum">130</span><a
      name="link130" id="link130"></a>against them. Nevertheless, against this
      danger statesmen should carefully provide; and, that they may do so, they
      should take especial care that neither the officers nor the soldiers do
      forget that they are also citizens. I do believe that the English army
      would have continued to obey the parliament with all duty, but for one
      act, which, as it was in intention, in seeming, and in immediate effect,
      worthy to be compared with the most famous in history, so was it, in its
      final consequence, most injurious. I speak of that ordinance called the <i>self-denying</i>,
      and of the new model of the army. By those measures the Commons gave up
      the command of their forces into the hands of men who were not of
      themselves. Hence, doubtless, derived no small honour to that noble
      assembly, which sacrificed to the hope of public good the assurance of
      private advantage. And, as to the conduct of the war, the scheme
      prospered. Witness the battle of Naseby, and the memorable exploits of
      Fairfaix in the west. But thereby the Parliament lost that hold on the
      soldiers and that power to control them, which they retained while every
      regiment was commanded by their own members. Politicians there be, who
      would wholly divide the legislative from the executive power. In the
      golden age this may have succeeded; in the millennium it may succeed
      again. But, where great armies and great taxes are required, there the
      executive government must always hold a great authority, which authority,
      that it may not oppress and destroy the legislature, must be in some
      manner blended with it. The leaders of foreign mercenaries have always
      been most dangerous to a country. The officers of native armies, deprived
      of the civil privileges of other men, are as much to be feared. This was
      the great <span class="pagenum">131</span><a name="link131"
       id="link131"></a>error of that Parliament; and, though an error it were,
      it was an error generous, virtuous, and more to be deplored than censured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hence came the power of the army and its leaders, and especially of that
      most famous leader, whom both in our conversation to-day, and in that
      discourse, whereon I before touched, you have, in my poor opinion, far too
      roughly handled. Wherefore you speak contemptibly of his parts I know not;
      but I suspect that you are not free from the error common to studious and
      speculative men. Because Oliver was an ungraceful orator, and never said,
      either in public or private, anything memorable, you will have it that he
      was of a mean capacity. Sure this is unjust. Many men have there been
      ignorant of letters, without wit, without eloquence, who yet had the
      wisdom to devise, and the courage to perform, that which they lacked
      language to explain. Such men often, in troubled times, have worked out
      the deliverance of nations and their own greatness, not by logic, not by
      rhetoric, but by wariness in success, by calmness in danger, by fierce and
      stubborn resolution in all adversity. The hearts of men are their books;
      events are their tutors; great actions are their eloquence: and such an
      one, in my judgment, was his late Highness, who, if none were to treat his
      name scornfully now who shook not at the sound of it while he lived,
      would, by very few, be mentioned otherwise than with reverence. His own
      deeds shall avouch him for a great statesman, a great soldier, a true
      lover of his country, a merciful and generous conqueror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For his faults, let us reflect that they who seem to lead are oftentimes
      most constrained to follow. They who will mix with men, and specially they
      who will <span class="pagenum">132</span><a name="link132"
       id="link132"></a>govern them, must, in many things, obey them. They who
      will yield to no such conditions may be hermits, but cannot be generals
      and statesmen. If a man will walk straight forward without turning to the
      right or the left, he must walk in a desert, and not in Cheapside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus was he enforced to do many things which jumped not with his
      inclination nor made for his honour; because the army, on which alone he
      could depend for power and life, might not otherwise be contented. And I,
      for mine own part, marvel less that he sometimes was fain to indulge their
      violence than that he could so often restrain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that he dissolved the Parliament, I praise him It then was so
      diminished in numbers, as well by the death as by the exclusion of
      members, that it was no longer the same assembly; and, if at that time it
      had made itself perpetual, we should have been governed, not by an English
      House of Commons, but by a Venetian Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If in his following rule he overstepped the laws, I pity rather than
      condemn him. He may be compared to that Mæandrius of Samos, of whom
      Herodotus saith, in his Thalia, that, wishing to be of all men the most
      just, he was not able; for after the death of Polycrates he offered
      freedom to the people; and not till certain of them threatened to call him
      to a reckoning for what he had formerly done, did he change his purpose,
      and make himself a tyrant, lest he should be treated as a criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such was the case of Oliver. He gave to his country a form of government
      so free and admirable that, in near six thousand years, human wisdom hath
      never devised any more excellent contrivance for human happiness. To
      himself he reserved so little power <span class="pagenum">133</span><a
      name="link133" id="link133"></a>that it would scarcely have sufficed for
      his safety, and it is a marvel that it could suffice for his ambition.
      When, after that, he found that the members of his parliament disputed his
      right even to that small authority which he had kept, when he might have
      kept all, then indeed I own that he began to govern by the sword those who
      would not suffer him to govern by the law.

      &ldquo;But, for the rest, what sovereign was ever more princely in pardoning
      injuries, in conquering enemies, in extending the dominions and the renown
      of his people? What sea, what shore did he not mark with imperishable
      memorials of his friendship or his vengeance? The gold of Spain, the steel
      of Sweden, the ten thousand sails of Holland, availed nothing against him.
      While every foreign state trembled at our arms, we sat secure from all
      assault. War, which often so strangely troubles both husbandry and
      commerce, never silenced the song of our reapers, or the sound of our
      looms. Justice was equally administered; God was freely worshipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now look at that which we have taken in exchange. With the restored king
      have come over to us vices of every sort, and most the basest and most
      shameful,&mdash;lust without love&mdash;servitude, without loyalty&mdash;foulness
      of speech&mdash;dishonesty of dealing&mdash;grinning contempt of all
      things good and generous. The throne is surrounded by men whom the former
      Charles would have spurned from his footstool. The altar is served by
      slaves whose knees are supple to every being but God. Rhymers, whose books
      the hangman should burn, pandars actors, and buffoons, these drink a
      health and throw a main with the King; these have stars on their breasts
      and gold sticks in <span class="pagenum">134</span><a name="link134"
       id="link134"></a>their hands; these shut out from his presence the best
      and bravest of those who bled for his house. Even so doth God visit those
      who know not how to value freedom. He gives them over to the tyranny which
      they have desired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; said Mr. Cowley, &ldquo;dispute with you on this argument. But, if
      it be as you say, how can you maintain that England hath been so greatly
      advantaged by the rebellion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand me rightly, Sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Milton. &ldquo;This nation is not given
      over to slavery and vice. We tasted indeed the fruits of liberty before
      they had well ripened. Their flavour was harsh and bitter; and we turned
      from them with loathing to the sweeter poisons of servitude. This is but
      for a time. England is sleeping on the lap of Dalilah, traitorously
      chained, but not yet shorn of strength. Let the cry be once heard&mdash;the
      Philistines be upon thee; and at once that sleep will be broken, and those
      chains will be as flax in the fire. The great Parliament hath left behind
      it in our hearts and minds a hatred of tyrants, a just knowledge of our
      rights, a scorn of vain and deluding names; and that the revellers of
      Whitehall shall surely find. The sun is darkened; but it is only for a
      moment: it is but an eclipse; though all birds of evil omen have begun to
      scream, and all ravenous beasts have gone forth to prey, thinking it to be
      midnight. Woe to them if they be abroad when the rays again shine forth!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king hath judged ill. Had he been wise he would have remembered that
      he owed his restoration only to confusions which had wearied us out, and
      made us eager for repose. He would have known that the folly and perfidy
      of a prince would restore to the good <span class="pagenum">135</span><a
      name="link135" id="link135"></a>old cause many hearts which had been
      alienated thence by the turbulence of factions; for, if I know aught of
      history, or of the heart of man, he will soon learn that the last champion
      of the people was not destroyed when he murdered Vane, nor seduced when he
      beguiled Fairfax.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cowley seemed to me not to take much amiss what Mr. Milton had said
      touching that thankless court, which had indeed but poorly requited his
      own good service. He only said, therefore, &ldquo;Another rebellion! Alas! alas!
      Mr. Milton! If there be no choice but between despotism and anarchy, I
      prefer despotism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many men,&rdquo; said Mr. Milton, &ldquo;have floridly and ingeniously compared
      anarchy and despotism; but they who so amuse themselves do but look at
      separate parts of that which is truly one great whole. Each is the cause
      and the effect of the other; the evils of either are the evils of both.
      Thus do states move on in the same eternal cycle, which, from the remotest
      point, brings them back again to the same sad starting-post: and, till
      both those who govern and those who obey shall learn and mark this great
      truth, men can expect little through the future, as they have known little
      through the past, save vicissitudes of extreme evils, alternately
      producing and produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will rulers learn that, where liberty is not security and order can
      never be? We talk of absolute power; but all power hath limits, which, if
      not fixed by the moderation of the governors, will be fixed by the force
      of the governed. Sovereigns may send their opposers to dungeons; they may
      clear out a senate-house with soldiers; they may enlist armies of spies;
      they may hang scores of the disaffected in chains at every cross road; but
      what power shall stand in that <span class="pagenum">136</span><a
      name="link136" id="link136"></a>frightful time when rebellion hath become
      a less evil than endurance? Who shall dissolve that terrible tribunal,
      which, in the hearts of the oppressed, denounces against the oppressor the
      doom of its wild justice? Who shall repeal the law of self-defence? What
      arms or discipline shall resist the strength of famine and despair? How
      often were the ancient Cæsars dragged from their golden palaces, stripped
      of their purple robes, mangled, stoned, defiled with filth, pierced with
      hooks, hurled into Tiber? How often have the Eastern Sultans perished by
      the sabres of their own janissaries, or the bow-strings of their own
      mutes! For no power which is not limited by laws can ever be protected by
      them. Small, therefore, is the wisdom of those who would fly to servitude
      as if it were a refuge from commotion; for anarchy is the sure consequence
      of tyranny. That governments may be safe, nations must be free. Their
      passions must have an outlet provided, lest they make one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was at Naples, I went with Signor Manso, a gentleman of excellent
      parts and breeding, who had been the familiar friend of that famous poet
      Torquato Tasso, to see the burning mountain Vesuvius. I wondered how the
      peasants could venture to dwell so fearlessly and cheerfully on its sides,
      when the lava was flowing from its summit; but Manso smiled, and told me
      that when the fire descends freely they retreat before it without haste or
      fear. They can tell how fast it will move, and how far; and they know,
      moreover, that, though it may work some little damage, it will soon cover
      the fields over which it hath passed with rich vineyards and sweet
      flowers. But, when the flames are pent up in the mountain, then it is that
      they have reason to fear; then it is that the earth sinks and the <span
      class="pagenum">137</span><a name="link137" id="link137"></a>sea
      swells; then cities are swallowed up; and their place knoweth them no
      more. So it is in politics: where the people is most closely restrained,
      there it gives the greatest shocks to peace and order; therefore would I
      say to all kings, let your demagogues lead crowds, lest they lead armies;
      let them bluster, lest they massacre; a little turbulence is, as it were,
      the rainbow of the state; it shows indeed that there is a passing shower;
      but it is a pledge that there shall be no deluge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is true,&rdquo; said Mr. Cowley: &ldquo;yet these admonitions are not less
      needful to subjects than to sovereigns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Mr. Milton; &ldquo;and, that I may end this long debate with a
      few words in which we shall both agree, I hold that, as freedom is the
      only safeguard of governments, so are order and moderation generally
      necessary to preserve freedom. Even the vainest opinions of men are not to
      be outraged by those who propose to themselves the happiness of men for
      their end, and who must work with the passions of men for their means. The
      blind reverence for things ancient is indeed so foolish that it might make
      a wise man laugh, if it were not also sometimes so mischievous that it
      would rather make a good man weep. Yet, since it may not be wholly cured,
      it must be discreetly indulged; and therefore those who would amend evil
      laws should consider rather how much it may be safe to spare, than how
      much it may be possible to change. Have you not heard that men who have
      been shut up for many years in dungeons shrink if they see the light, and
      fall down if their irons be struck off. And so, when nations have long
      been in the house of bondage, the chains which have crippled them are
      necessary to <span class="pagenum">138</span><a name="link138"
       id="link138"></a>support them, the darkness which hath weakened their
      sight is necessary to preserve it. Therefore release them not too rashly,
      lest they curse their freedom and pine for their prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think indeed that the renowned Parliament, of which we have talked so
      much, did show, until it became subject to the soldiers, a singular and
      admirable moderation, in such times scarcely to be hoped, and most worthy
      to be an example to all that shall come after. But on this argument I have
      said enough: and I will therefore only pray to Almighty God that those who
      shall, in future times, stand forth in defence of our liberties, as well
      civil as religious, may adorn the good cause by mercy, prudence, and
      soberness, to the glory of his name and the happiness and honour of the
      English people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so ended that discourse; and not long after we were set on shore again
      at the Temple-gardens, and there parted company: and the same evening I
      took notes of what had been said, which I have here more fully set down,
      from regard both to the fame of the men, and the importance of the
      subject-matter.

      celebrity of the great classical writers is confined within no limits,
      except those which separate civilized from savage man. Their works are the
      common property of every polished nation. They have furnished subjects for
      the painter, and models for the poet. In the minds of the educated classes
      throughout Europe, their names are indissolubly associated with the
      endearing recollections of childhood,&mdash;the old school room,&mdash;the
      dog-eared grammar,&mdash;the first prize,&mdash;the tears so often shed
      and so quickly dried. So great is the veneration with which they are
      regarded, that even the editors and commentators who perform the lowest
      menial offices to their memory, are considered, like the equerries and
      chamberlains of sovereign princes, as entitled to a high rank in the table
      of literary precedence. It is, therefore, somewhat singular that their
      productions should so rarely have been examined on just and philosophical
      principles of criticism. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient writers themselves afford us but little <span class="pagenum">140</span><a
      name="link140" id="link140"></a>assistance. When they particularise, they
      are commonly trivial: when they would generalise, they become indistinct.
      An exception must, indeed, be made in favour of Aristotle. Both in
      analysis and in combination, that great man was without a rival. No
      philosopher has ever possessed, in an equal degree, the talent either of
      separating established systems into their primary elements, or of
      connecting detached phenomena in harmonious systems. He was the great
      fashioner of the intellectual chaos; he changed its darkness into light,
      and its discord into order. He brought to literary researches the same
      vigor and amplitude of mind to which both physical and metaphysical
      science are so greatly indebted. His fundamental principles of criticism
      are excellent. To cite only a single instance;&mdash;the doctrine which he
      established, that poetry is an imitative art, when justly understood, is
      to the critic what the compass is to the navigator. With it he may venture
      upon the most extensive excursions. Without it he must creep cautiously
      along the coast, or lose himself in a trackless expanse, and trust, at
      best, to the guidance of an occasional star. It is a discovery which
      changes a caprice into a science.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general propositions of Aristotle are valuable. But the merit of the
      superstructure bears no proportion to that of the foundation. This is
      partly to be ascribed to the character of the philosopher, who, though
      qualified to do all that could be done by the resolving and combining
      powers of the understanding, seems not to have possessed much of
      sensibility or imagination. Partly, also, it may be attributed to the
      deficiency of materials. The great works of genius which then existed were
      not either sufficiently numerous <span class="pagenum">141</span><a
      name="link141" id="link141"></a>or sufficiently varied to enable any man
      to form a perfect code of literature. To require that a critic should
      conceive classes of composition which had never existed, and then
      investigate their principles, would be as unreasonable as the demand of
      Nebuchadnezzar, who expected his magicians first to tell him his dream and
      then to interpret it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his deficiencies, Aristotle was the most enlightened and profound
      critic of antiquity. Dionysius was far from possessing the same exquisite
      subtilty, or the same vast comprehension. But he had access to a much
      greater number of specimens; and he had devoted himself, as it appears,
      more exclusively to the study of elegant literature. His peculiar
      judgments are of more value than his general principles. He is only the
      historian of literature. Aristotle is its philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quintilian applied to general literature the same principles by which he
      had been accustomed to judge of the declamations of his pupils. He looks
      for nothing but rhetoric, and rhetoric not of the highest order. He speaks
      coldly of the incomparable works of Æschylus. He admires, beyond
      expression, those inexhaustible mines of common-places, the plays of
      Euripides. He bestows a few vague words on the poetical character of
      Homer. He then proceeds to consider him merely as an orator. An orator
      Homer doubtless was, and a great orator. But surely nothing is more
      remarkable, in his admirable works, than the art with which his oratorical
      powers are made subservient to the purposes of poetry. Nor can I think
      Quintilian a great critic in his own province. Just as are many of his
      remarks, beautiful as are many of his illustrations, we can perpetually
      detect in his thoughts <span class="pagenum">142</span><a
      name="link142" id="link142"></a>that flavour which the soil of despotism
      generally communicates to all the fruits of genius. Eloquence was, in his
      time, little more than a condiment which served to stimulate in a despot
      the jaded appetite for panegyric, an amusement for the travelled nobles
      and the blue-stocking matrons of Rome. It is, therefore, with him, rather
      a sport than a war; it is a contest of foils, not of swords. He appears to
      think more of the grace of the attitude than of the direction and vigour
      of the thrust. It must be acknowledged, in justice to Quintilian, that
      this is an error to which Cicero has too often given the sanction, both of
      his precept and of his example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longinus seems to have had great sensibility, but little discrimination.
      He gives us eloquent sentences, but no principles. It was happily said
      that Montesquieu ought to have changed the name of his book from <i>L&rsquo;Esprit
      des Lois to L&rsquo;Esprit sur les Lois</i>. In the same manner the philosopher
      of Palmyra ought to have entitled his famous work, not &ldquo;Longinus on the
      Sublime,&rdquo; but &ldquo;The Sublimities of Longinus.&rdquo; The origin of the sublime is
      one of the most curious and interesting subjects of inquiry that can
      occupy the attention of a critic. In our own country it has been
      discussed, with great ability, and, I think, with very little success, by
      Burke and Dugald Stuart. Longinus dispenses himself from all
      investigations of this nature, by telling his friend Terentianus that he
      already knows every thing than can be said upon the question. It is to be
      regretted that Terentianus did not impart some of his knowledge to his
      instructor: for from Longinus we learn only that sublimity means height&mdash;or
      elevation. This name, so commodiously vague, is applied <span
      class="pagenum">143</span><a name="link143" id="link143"></a>indifferently
      to the noble prayer of Ajax in the Iliad, and to a passage of Plato about
      the human body, as full of conceits as an ode of Cowley. Having no fixed
      standard, Longinus is right only by accident. He is rather a fancier than
      a critic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern writers have been prevented by many causes from supplying the
      deficiencies of their classical predecessors. At the time of the revival
      of literature, no man could, without great and painful labour, acquire an
      accurate and elegant knowledge of the ancient languages. And,
      unfortunately, those grammatical and philological studies, without which
      it was impossible to understand the great works of Athenian and Roman
      genius, have a tendency to contract the views and deaden the sensibility
      of those who follow them with extreme assiduity. A powerful mind, which
      has been long employed in such studies, may be compared to the gigantic
      spirit in the Arabian tale, who was persuaded to contract himself to small
      dimensions in order to enter within the enchanted vessel, and when his
      prison had been closed upon him, found himself unable to escape from the
      narrow boundaries to the measure of which he had reduced his stature. When
      the means have long been the objects of application, they are naturally
      substituted for the end. It was said, by Eugene of Savoy, that the
      greatest generals have commonly been those who have been at once raised to
      command, and introduced to the great operations of war, without being
      employed in the petty calculations and manoeuvres which employ the time of
      an inferior officer. In literature the principle is equally sound. The
      great tactics of criticism will, in general, be best understood by those
      who have not had much practice in drilling syllables and particles. <span
      class="pagenum">144</span><a name="link144" id="link144"></a>I
      remember to have observed among the French Anas a ludicrous instance of
      this. A scholar, doubtless of great learning, recommends the study of some
      long Latin treatise, of which I now forget the name, on the religion,
      manners, government, and language of the early Greeks. &ldquo;For there,&rdquo; says
      he, &ldquo;you will learn every thing of importance that is contained in the
      Iliad and Odyssey, without the trouble of reading two such tedious books.&rdquo;
       Alas! it had not occurred to the poor gentleman that all the knowledge to
      which he attached so much value was useful only as it illustrated the
      great poems which he despised, and would be as worthless for any other
      purpose as the mythology of Caffraria, or the vocabulary of Otaheite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of those scholars who have disdained to confine themselves to verbal
      criticism few have been successful. The ancient languages have, generally,
      a magical influence on their faculties. They were &ldquo;fools called into a
      circle by Greek invocations.&rdquo; The Iliad and Æneid were to them not books,
      but curiosities, or rather reliques. They no more admired those works for
      their merits than a good Catholic venerates the house of the Virgin at
      Loretto for its architecture. Whatever was classical was good. Homer was a
      great poet; and so was Callimachus. The epistles of Cicero were fine; and
      so were those of Phalaris. Even with respect to questions of evidence they
      fell into the same error. The authority of all narrations, written in
      Greek or Latin, was the same with them. It never crossed their minds that
      the lapse of five hundred years, or the distance of five hundred leagues,
      could affect the accuracy of a narration;&mdash;that Livy could be a less
      veracious historian than Polybius;&mdash;or that Plutarch could know less
      about the friends of Xenophon <span class="pagenum">145</span><a
      name="link145" id="link145"></a>than Xenophon himself. Deceived by the
      distance of time, they seem to consider all the Classics as
      contemporaries; just as I have known people in England, deceived by the
      distance of place, take it for granted that all persons who live in India
      are neighbours, and ask an inhabitant of Bombay about the health of an
      acquaintance at Calcutta. It is to be hoped that no barbarian deluge will
      ever again pass over Europe. But, should such a calamity happen, it seems
      not improbable that some future Rollin or Gillies will compile a history
      of England from Miss Porter&rsquo;s Scottish Chiefs, Miss Lee&rsquo;s Recess, and Sir
      Nathaniel Wraxall&rsquo;s Memoirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is surely time that ancient literature should be examined in a
      different manner, without pedantical prepossessions, but with a just
      allowance, at the same time, for the difference of circumstances and
      manners. I am far from pretending to the knowledge or ability which such a
      task would require. All that I mean to offer is a collection of desultory
      remarks upon a most interesting portion of Greek literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be doubted-whether any compositions which have ever been produced
      in the world are equally perfect in their kind with the great Athenian
      orations. Genius is subject to the same laws which regulate the production
      of cotton and molasses. The supply adjusts itself to the demand. The
      quantity may be diminished by restrictions, and multiplied by bounties.
      The singular excellence to which eloquence attained at Athens is to be
      mainly attributed to the influence which it exerted there. In turbulent
      times, under a constitution purely democratic, among a people educated
      exactly to that point at which men are most susceptible of strong and
      sudden impressions, acute, but <span class="pagenum">146</span><a

      The taste and knowledge of the Athenian people was a favourite object of
      the contemptuous derision of Samuel Johnson; a man who knew nothing of
      Greek literature beyond the common school-books, and who seems to have
      brought to what he had read scarcely more than the discernment of a common
      school-boy. He used to assert, with that arrogant absurdity which, in
      spite of his great abilities and virtues, renders him, perhaps the most
      ridiculous character in literary history, that Demosthenes spoke to a
      people of brutes;&mdash;to a barbarous people;&mdash;that there could have
      been no civilisation before the invention of printing. Johnson was a keen
      but a very narrow-minded observer of mankind. He perpetually confounded
      their general nature with their particular circumstances. He knew London
      intimately. The sagacity of his remarks on its society is perfectly
      astonishing. But Fleet-street was the world to him. He saw that Londoners
      who did not read were profoundly ignorant; and he inferred that a Greek,
      who had few or no books, must have been as uninformed as one of Mr.
      Thrale&rsquo;s draymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seems to be, on the contrary, every reason to believe that, in
      general intelligence, the Athenian populace far surpassed the lower orders
      of any community that has ever existed. It must be considered, that to be
      a citizen was to be a legislator,&mdash;a soldier,&mdash;a judge,&mdash;one
      upon whose voice might depend the fate of the wealthiest tributary state,
      of the most eminent public man. The lowest offices, both of agriculture
      <span class="pagenum">147</span><a name="link147" id="link147"></a>and
      of trade, were, in common, performed by slaves. The commonwealth supplied
      its meanest members with the support of life, the opportunity of leisure,
      and the means of amusement. Books were indeed few: but they were
      excellent; and they were accurately known. It is not by turning over
      libraries, but by repeatedly perusing and intently contemplating a few
      great models, that the mind is best disciplined. A man of letters must now
      read much that he soon forgets, and much from which he learns nothing
      worthy to be remembered. The best works employ, in general, but a small
      portion of his time. Demosthenes is said to have transcribed six times the
      history of Thucydides. If he had been a young politician of the present
      age, he might in the same space of time have skimmed innumerable
      newspapers and pamphlets. I do not condemn that desultory mode of study
      which the state of things, in our day, renders a matter of necessity. But
      I may be allowed to doubt whether the changes on which the admirers of
      modern institutions delight to dwell have improved our condition so much
      in reality as in appearance. Rumford, it is said, proposed to the elector
      of Bavaria a scheme for feeding his soldiers at a much cheaper rate than
      formerly. His plan was simply to compel them to masticate their food
      thoroughly. A small quantity, thus eaten, would, according to that famous
      projector, afford more sustenance than a large meal hastily devoured. I do
      not know how Rumford&rsquo;s proposition was received; but to the mind, I
      believe, it will be found more nutritious to digest a page than to devour
      a volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Books, however, were the least part of the education of an Athenian
      citizen. Let us, for a moment, transport ourselves, in thought, to that
      glorious city. Let <span class="pagenum">148</span><a name="link148"
       id="link148"></a>us imagine that we are entering its gates, in the time of
      its power and glory. A crowd is assembled round a portico. All are gazing
      with delight at the entablature; for Phidias is putting up the frieze. We
      turn into another street; a rhapsodist is reciting there: men, women,
      children are thronging round him: the tears are running down their cheeks:
      their eyes are fixed: their very breath is still; for he is telling how
      Priam fell at the feet of Achilles, and kissed those hands,&mdash;the
      terrible,&mdash;the murderous,&mdash;which had slain so many of his sons.
      (1) We enter the public place; there is a ring of youths, all leaning
      forward, with sparkling eyes, and gestures of expectation. Socrates is
      pitted against the famous atheist, from Ionia, and has just brought him to
      a contradiction in terms. But we are interrupted. The herald is crying&mdash;&ldquo;Room
      for the Prytanes.&rdquo; The general assembly is to meet. The people are
      swarming in on every side. Proclamation is made&mdash;&ldquo;Who wishes to
      speak.&rdquo; There is a shout, and a clapping of hands; Pericles is mounting
      the stand. Then for a play of Sophocles; and away to sup with Aspasia. I
      know of no modern university which has so excellent a system of education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowledge thus acquired and opinions thus formed were, indeed, likely to
      be, in some respects, defective. Propositions which are advanced in
      discourse generally result from a partial view of the question, and cannot
      be kept under examination long enough to be corrected. Men of great
      conversational powers almost universally practise a sort of lively
      sophistry and exaggeration, which deceives, for the moment, both
      themselves <span class="pagenum">149</span><a name="link149"
       id="link149"></a>and their auditors. Thus we see doctrines, which cannot
      bear a close inspection, triumph perpetually in drawing-rooms, in debating
      societies, and even in legislative or judicial assemblies. To the
      conversational education of the Athenians I am inclined to attribute the
      great looseness of reasoning which is remarkable in most of their
      scientific writings. Even the most illogical of modern writers would stand
      perfectly aghast at the puerile fallacies which seem to have deluded some
      of the greatest men of antiquity. Sir Thomas Lethbridge would stare at the
      political economy of Xenophon; and the author of <i>Soirées de Pétersbourg</i>
      would be ashamed of some of the metaphysical arguments of Plato. But the
      very circumstances which retarded the growth of science were peculiarly
      favourable to the cultivation of eloquence. From the early habit of taking
      a share in animated discussion the intelligent student would derive that
      readiness of resource, that copiousness of language, and that knowledge of
      the temper and understanding of an audience, which are far more valuable
      to an orator than the greatest logical powers.
    </p>

      Horace has prettily compared poems to those paintings of which the effect
      varies as the spectator changes his stand. The same remark applies with at
      least equal justice to speeches. They must be read with the temper of
      those to whom they were addressed, or they must necessarily appear to
      offend against the laws of taste and reason; as the finest picture, seen
      in a light different from that for which it was designed, will appear fit
      only for a sign. This is perpetually forgotten by those who criticise
      oratory. Because they are reading at leisure, pausing at every line,
      reconsidering every argument, they forget that <span class="pagenum">150</span><a
      name="link150" id="link150"></a>the hearers were hurried from point to
      point too rapidly to detect the fallacies through which they were
      conducted; that they had no time to disentangle sophisms, or to notice
      slight inaccuracies of expression; that elaborate excellence, either of
      reasoning or of language, would have been absolutely thrown away. To recur
      to the analogy of the sister art, these connoisseurs examine a panorama
      through a microscope, and quarrel with a scene-painter because he does not
      give to his work the exquisite finish of Gerard Dow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oratory is to be estimated on principles different from those which are
      applied to other productions. Truth is the object of philosophy and
      history. Truth is the object even of those works which are peculiarly
      called works of fiction, but which, in fact, bear the same relation to
      history which algebra bears to arithmetic. The merit of poetry, in its
      wildest forms, still consists in its truth,&mdash;truth conveyed to the
      understanding, not directly by the words, but circuitously by means of
      imaginative associations, which serve as its conductors. The object of
      oratory alone is not truth, but persuasion. The admiration of the
      multitude does not make Moore a greater poet, than Coleridge, or Beattie a
      greater philosoper than Berkeley. But the criterion of eloquence is
      different. A speaker who exhausts the whole philosophy of a question, who
      displays every grace of style, yet produces no effect on his audience, may
      be a great essayist, a great statesman, a great master of composition; but
      he is not an orator. If he miss the mark, it makes no difference whether
      he have taken aim too high or too low.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the great freedom of the press in England has been, in a
      great measure, to destroy this distinction, <span class="pagenum">151</span><a
      name="link151" id="link151"></a>and to leave among us little of what I
      call Oratory Proper. Our legislators, our candidates, on great occasions
      even our advocates, address themselves less to the audience than to the
      reporters. They think less of the few hearers than of the innumerable
      readers. At Athens the case was different; there the only object of the
      speaker was immediate conviction and persuasion. He, therefore, who would
      justly appreciate the merit of the Grecian orators should place himself,
      as nearly as possible, in the situation of their auditors: he should
      divest himself of his modern feelings and acquirements, and make the
      prejudices and interests of the Athenian citizen his own. He who studies
      their works in this spirit will find that many of those things which, to
      an English reader, appear to be blemishes,&mdash;the frequent violation of
      those excellent rules of evidence by which our courts of law are
      regulated,&mdash;the introduction of extraneous matter,&mdash;the
      reference to considerations of political expediency in judicial
      investigations,&mdash;the assertions, without proof,&mdash;the passionate
      entreaties,&mdash;the furious invectives,&mdash;are really proofs of the
      prudence and address of the speakers. He must not dwell maliciously on
      arguments or phrases, but acquiesce in his first impressions. It requires
      repeated perusal and reflection to decide rightly on any other portion of
      literature. But with respect to works of which the merit depends on their
      instantaneous effect the most hasty judgment is likely to be best.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of eloquence at Athens is remarkable. From a very early period
      great speakers had flourished there. Pisistratus and Themistocles are said
      to have owed much of their influence to their talents for debate. We
      learn, with more certainty, that Pericles was distinguished by
      extraordinary oratorical powers. <span class="pagenum">152</span><a
      name="link152" id="link152"></a>The substance of some of his speeches is
      transmitted to us by Thucydides; and that excellent writer has doubtless
      faithfully reported the general line of his arguments. But the manner,
      which in oratory is of at least as much consequence as the matter, was of
      no importance to his narration. It is evident that he has not attempted to
      preserve it. Throughout his work, every speech on every subject, whatever
      may have been the character or the dialect of the speaker, is in exactly
      the same form. The grave king of Sparta, the furious demagogue of Athens,
      the general encouraging his army, the captive supplicating for his life,
      all are represented as speakers in one unvaried style,&mdash;a style
      moreover wholly unfit for oratorical purposes. His mode of reasoning is
      singularly elliptical,&mdash;in reality most consecutive,&mdash;yet in
      appearance often incoherent. His meaning, in itself sufficiently
      perplexing, is compressed into the fewest possible words. His great
      fondness for antithetical expression has not a little conduced to&rsquo; this
      effect. Every one must have observed how much more the sense is condensed
      in the verses of Pope and his imitators, who never ventured to continue
      the same clause from couplet to couplet, than in those of poets who allow
      themselves that license. Every artificial division, which is strongly
      marked, and which frequently recurs, has the same tendency. The natural
      and perspicuous expression which spontaneously rises to the mind will
      often refuse to accommodate itself to such a form. It is necessary either
      to expand it into weakness, or to compress it into almost impenetrable
      density. The latter is generally the choice of an able man, and was
      assuredly the choice of Thucydides.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is scarcely necessary to say that such speeches could never have been
      delivered. They are perhaps <span class="pagenum">153</span><a
      name="link153" id="link153"></a>among the most difficult passages in the
      Greek language, and would probably have been scarcely more intelligible to
      an Athenian auditor than to a modern reader. Their obscurity was
      acknowledged by Cicero, who was as intimate with the literature and
      language of Greece as the most accomplished of its natives, and who seems
      to have held a respectable rank among the Greek authors. Their difficulty
      to a modern reader lies, not in the words, but in the reasoning. A
      dictionary is of far less use in studying them than a clear head and a
      close attention to the context. They are valuable to the scholar as
      displaying, beyond almost any other compositions, the powers of the finest
      of languages: they are valuable to the philosopher as illustrating the
      morals and manners of a most interesting age: they abound in just thought
      and energetic expression. But they do not enable us to form any accurate
      opinion on the merits of the early Greek orators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it cannot be doubted that, before the Persian wars, Athens had
      produced eminent speakers, yet the period during which eloquence most
      flourished among her citizens was by no means that of her greatest power
      and glory. It commenced at the close of the Peloponnesian war. In fact,
      the steps by which Athenian oratory approached to its finished excellence
      seem to have been almost contemporaneous with those by which the Athenian
      character and the Athenian empire sunk to degradation. At the time when
      the little commonwealth achieved those victories which twenty-five
      eventful centuries have left unequalled, eloquence was in its infancy. The
      deliverers of Greece became its plunderers and oppressors. Unmeasured
      exaction, atrocious vengeance, the madness of the multitude, the tyranny
      <span class="pagenum">154</span><a name="link154" id="link154"></a>of
      the great, filled the Cyclades with tears, and blood, and mourning. The
      sword unpeopled whole islands in a day. The plough passed over the ruins
      of famous cities. The imperial republic sent forth her children by
      thousands to pine in the quarries of Syracuse, or to feed the vultures of
      Ægospotami. She was at length reduced by famine and slaughter to humble
      herself before her enemies, and to purchase existence by the sacrifice of
      her empire and her laws. During these disastrous and gloomy years, oratory
      was advancing towards its highest excellence. And it was when the moral,
      the political, and the military character of the people was most utterly
      degraded, it was when the viceroy of a Macedonian sovereign gave law to
      Greece, that the courts of Athens witnessed the most splendid contest of
      eloquence that the world has ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      The causes of this phenomenon it is not, I think, difficult to assign. The
      division of labour operates on the productions of the orator as it does on
      those of the mechanic. It was remarked by the ancients that the
      Pentathlete, who divided his attention between several exercises, though
      he could not vie with a boxer in the use of the cestus, or with one who
      had confined his attention to running in the contest of the stadium, yet
      enjoyed far greater general vigour and health than either. It is the same
      with the mind. The superiority in technical skill is often more than
      compensated by the inferiority in general intelligence. And this is
      peculiarly the case in politics. States have always been best governed by
      men who have taken a wide view of public affairs, and who have rather a
      general acquaintance with many sciences than a perfect mastery of one. The
      union of the political and military departments in Greece contributed not
      a little to the splendour of its <span class="pagenum">155</span><a
      name="link155" id="link155"></a>early history. After their separation more
      skilful generals and greater speakers appeared; but the breed of statesmen
      dwindled and became almost extinct. Themistocles or Pericles would have
      been no match for Demosthenes in the assembly, or for Iphicrates in the
      field. But surely they were incomparably better fitted than either for the
      supreme direction of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is indeed a remarkable coincidence between the progress of the art
      of war, and that of the art of oratory, among the Greeks. They both
      advanced to perfection by contemporaneous steps, and from similar causes.
      The early speakers, like the early warriors of Greece, were merely a
      militia. It was found that in both employments practice and discipline
      gave superiority. (1) Each pursuit therefore became first an art, and then
      a trade. In proportion as the professors of each became more expert in
      their particular craft, they became less respectable in their general
      character.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) It has often occurred to me, that to the circumstances
     mentioned in the text is to be referred one of the most
     remarkable events in Grecian history; I mean the silent but
     rapid downfall of the Lacedæmonian power. Soon after the
     termination of the Peloponnesian war, the strength of
     Lacedaemon began to decline. Its military discipline, its
     social institutions, were the same. Agesilaus, during whose
     reign the change took place, was the ablest of its kings.
     Yet the Spartan armies were frequently defeated in pitched
     battles,&mdash;an occurrence considered impossible in the earlier
     ages of Greece. They are allowed to have fought most
     bravely; yet they were no longer attended by the success to
     which they had formerly been accustomed. No solution of
     these circumstances is offered, as far as I know, by any
     ancient author. The real cause, I conceive, was this. The
     Lacedæmonians, alone among the Greeks, formed a permanent
     standing army. While the citizens of other commonwealths
     were engaged in agriculture and trade, they had no
     employment whatever but the study of military discipline.
     Hence, during the Persian and Peloponnesian wars, they had
     that advantage over their neighbours which regular troops
     always possess over militia. This advantage they lost, when
     other states began, at a later period, to employ mercenary
     forces, who were probably as superior to them in the art of
     war as they had hitherto been to their antagonists.
     <span class="pagenum">156</span><a name="link156" id="link156"></a>Their skill had been obtained at too great expense to
     be employed only from disinterested views. Thus, the
     soldiers forgot that they were citizens, and the orators
     that they were statesmen. I know not to what Demosthenes and
     his famous contemporaries can be so justly compared as to
     those mercenary troops who, in their time, overran Greece;
     or those who, from similar causes, were some centuries ago
     the scourge of the Italian republics,&mdash;perfectly acquainted
     with every part of their profession, irresistible in the
     field, powerful to defend or to destroy, but defending
     without love, and destroying without hatred. We may despise
     the characters of these political <i>Condottieri</i>; but it is
     impossible to examine the system of their tactics without
     being amazed at its perfection.
</pre>
    <p>
      I had intended to proceed to this examination, and to consider separately
      the remains of Lysias, of Æschines, of Demosthenes, and of Isocrates, who,
      though strictly speaking he was rather a pamphleteer than an orator,
      deserves, on many accounts, a place in such a disquisition. The length of
      my prolegomena and digressions compels me to postpone this part of the
      subject to another occasion. A Magazine is certainly a delightful
      invention for a very idle or a very busy man. He is not compelled to
      complete his plan or to adhere to his subject. He may ramble as far as lie
      is inclined, and stop as soon as he is tired. No one takes the trouble to
      recollect his contradictory opinions or his unredeemed pledges. He may be
      as superficial, as inconsistent, and as careless as he chooses. Magazines
      resemble those little angels, who, according to the pretty Rabbinical
      tradition, are generated every morning by the brook which rolls over the
      flowers of Paradise,&mdash;whose life is a song,&mdash;who <span
      class="pagenum">157</span><a name="link157" id="link157"></a>warble
      till sunset, and then sink back without regret into nothingness. Such
      spirits have nothing to do with the detecting spear of Ithuriel or the
      victorious sword of Michael. It is enough for them to please and be
      forgotten.

      employed by some others. Yet my predictions will, I believe, be found more

      will be the younger son of the younger branch of one of the most
      respectable families in England. He will be lineally descended from
      Quongti, the famous Chinese liberal, who, after the failure of the heroic
      attempt of his party to obtain a constitution from the Emperor Fim Fam,
      will take refuge in England, in the twenty-third century. Here his
      descendants will obtain considerable note; and one branch of the family
      will be raised to the peerage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard, however, though destined to exalt his family to distinction far
      nobler than any which wealth or <span class="pagenum">160</span><a
      name="link160" id="link160"></a>titles can bestow, will be born to a very
      scanty fortune He will display in his early youth such striking talents as
      will attract the notice of Viscount Quongti, his third cousin, then
      secretary of state for the Steam Department. At the expense of this
      eminent nobleman, he will be sent to prosecute his studies at the
      university of Tombuctoo. To that illustrious seat of the muses all the
      ingenuous youth of every country will then be attracted by the high
      scientific character of Professor Quashaboo, and the eminent literary
      attainments of Professor Kissey Kickey. In spite of this formidable
      competition, however, Quongti will acquire the highest honours in every
      department of knowledge, and will obtain the esteem of his associates by
      his amiable and unaffected manners. The guardians of the young Duke of
      Carrington, premier peer of England, and the last remaining scion of the
      ancient and illustrious house of Smith, will be desirous to secure so able
      an instructor for their ward. With the Duke, Quongti will perform the
      grand tour, and visit the polished courts of Sydney and Capetown. After
      prevailing on his pupil, with great difficulty, to subdue a violent and
      imprudent passion which he had conceived for a Hottentot lady, of great
      beauty and accomplishments indeed, but of dubious character, he will
      travel with him to the United States of America. But that tremendous war
      which will be fatal to American liberty will at that time be raging
      through the whole federation. At New York the travellers will hear of the
      final defeat and death of the illustrious champion of freedom, Jonathan
      Hioffinbottom, and of the elevation of Ebenezer Hogsflesh to the perpetual
      Presidency. They will not choose to proceed in a journey which would
      expose <span class="pagenum">161</span><a name="link161" id="link161"></a>them
      to the insults of that brutal soldiery, whose cruelty and rapacity will
      have devastated Mexico and Colombia, and now, at length, enslaved their
      own country.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their return to England, a.d. 2810, the death of the Duke will compel
      his preceptor to seek for a subsistence by literary labours. His fame will
      be raised by many small productions of considerable merit; and he will at
      last obtain a permanent place in the highest class of writers by his great
      epic poem.
    </p>
    <p>
      This celebrated work will become, with unexampled rapidity, a popular
      favourite. The sale will be so beneficial to the author that, instead of
      going; about the dirty streets on his velocipede, he will be enabled to
      set up his balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character of this noble poem will be so finely and justly given in the
      Tombuctoo Review for April, 2825, that I cannot refrain from translating
      the passage. The author will be our poet&rsquo;s old preceptor, Professor Kissey
      Kickey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In pathos, in splendour of language, in sweetness of versification, Mr.
      Quongti has long been considered as unrivalled. In his exquisite poem on
      the <i>Omithorynchus Paradoxus</i> all these qualities are displayed in
      their greatest perfection. How exquisitely does that work arrest and
      embody the undefined and vague shadows which flit over an imaginative
      mind. The cold worldling may not comprehend it; but it will find a
      response in the bosom of every youthful poet, of every enthusiastic lover
      who has seen an Ornithorynchus Paradoxus by moonlight. But we were yet to
      learn that he possessed the comprehension, the judgment, and the fertility
      of mind indispensable to the epic poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is difficult to conceive a plot more perfect than that of the
      &lsquo;Wellingtoniad.&rsquo; It is most faithful to the <span class="pagenum">162</span><a
      name="link162" id="link162"></a>manners of the age to which it relates. It
      preserves exactly all the historical circumstances, and interweaves them
      most artfully with all the <i>speciosa miracula</i> of supernatural
      agency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus far the learned Professor of Humanity in the university of Tombuctoo.
      I fear that the critics of our time will form an opinion diametrically
      opposite as to these very points. Some will, I fear, be disgusted by the
      machinery, which is derived from the mythology of ancient Greece. I can
      only say that in the twenty-ninth century, that machinery will be
      universally in use among poets; and that Quongti will use it, partly in
      conformity with the general practice, and partly from a veneration,
      perhaps excessive, for the great remains of classical antiquity, which
      will then, as now, be assiduously read by every man of education; though
      Tom Moore&rsquo;s songs will be forgotten, and only three copies of Lord Byron&rsquo;s
      works will exist: one in the possession of King George the Nineteenth, one
      in the Duke of Carrington&rsquo;s collection, and one in the library of the
      British Museum. Finally, should any good people be concerned to hear that
      Pagan fictions will so long retain their influence over literature, let
      them reflect that, as the Bishop of St. David&rsquo;s says, in his &ldquo;Proofs of
      the Inspiration of the Sibylline Verses,&rdquo; read at the last meeting of the
      Royal Society of Literature, &ldquo;at all events, a Pagan is not a Papist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some readers of the present day may think that Quongti is by no means
      entitled to the compliments which his Negro critic pays him on his
      adherence to the historical circumstances of the time in which he has
      chosen his subject; that, where he introduces any trait of our manners, it
      is in the wrong place, and that he confounds the customs of our age with
      those of <span class="pagenum">163</span><a name="link163"
       id="link163"></a>much more remote periods. I can only say that the charge
      is infinitely more applicable to Homer, Virgil, and Tasso. If, therefore,
      the reader should detect, in the following abstract of the plot, any
      little deviation from strict historical accuracy, let him reflect, for a
      moment, whether Agamemnon would not have found as much to censure in the
      Iliad,&mdash;Dido in the Æneid,&mdash;or Godfrey in the Jerusalem. Let him
      not suffer his opinions to depend on circumstances which cannot possibly
      affect the truth or falsehood of the representation. If it be impossible
      for a single man to kill hundreds in battle, the impossibility is not
      diminished by distance of time. If it be as certain that Rinaldo never
      disenchanted a forest in Palestine as it is that the Duke of Wellington
      never disenchanted the forest of Soignies, can we, as rational men,
      tolerate the one story and ridicule the other? Of this, at least, I am
      certain, that whatever excuse we have for admiring the plots of those
      famous poems our children will have for extolling that of the
      &ldquo;Wellingtoniad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shall proceed to give a sketch of the narrative. The subject is &ldquo;The
      Reign of the Hundred Days.&rdquo;

      poem commences, in form, with a solemn proposition of the subject. Then
      the muse is invoked to give the poet accurate information as to the causes
      of so terrible a commotion. The answer to this question, being, it is to
      be supposed, the joint production of the poet and the muse, ascribes the
      event to circumstances which have hitherto eluded all the research of
      political writers, namely, the influence of the god Mars, who, we are told
      had some forty years before usurped the <span class="pagenum">164</span><a
      name="link164" id="link164"></a>conjugal rights of old Carlo Buonaparte,
      and given birth to Napoleon. By his incitement it was that the emperor
      with his devoted companions was now on the sea, returning to his ancient
      dominions. The gods were at present, fortunately for the adventurer,
      feasting with the Ethiopians, whose entertainments, according to the
      ancient custom described by Homer, they annually attended, with the same
      sort of condescending gluttony which now carries the cabinet to Guildhall
      on the 9th of November. Neptune, was, in consequence, absent, and unable
      to prevent the enemy of his favourite island from crossing his element.
      Boreas, however, who had his abode on the banks of the Russian ocean, and
      who, like Thetis in the Iliad, was not of sufficient quality to have an
      invitation to Ethiopia, resolves to destroy the armament which brings war
      and danger to his beloved Alexander. He accordingly raises a storm which
      is most powerfully described. Napoleon bewails the inglorious fate for
      which he seems to be reserved. &ldquo;Oh! thrice happy,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;those who
      were frozen to death at Krasnoi, or slaughtered at Leipzic. Oh, Kutusoff,
      bravest of the Russians, wherefore was I not permitted to fall by thy
      victorious sword?&rdquo; He then offers a prayer to Æolus, and vows to him a
      sacrifice of a black ram. In consequence, the god recalls his turbulent
      subject; the sea is calmed; and the ship anchors in the port of Frejus.
      Napoleon and Bertrand, who is always called the faithful Bertrand, land to
      explore the country; Mars meets them disguised as a lancer of the guard,
      wearing the cross of the legion of honour. He advises them to apply for
      necessaries of all kinds to the governor, shows them the way, and
      disappears with a strong smell of gunpowder. Napoleon makes a pathetic
      <span class="pagenum">165</span><a name="link165" id="link165"></a>speech,
      and enters the governor&rsquo;s house. Here he sees hanging up a fine print of
      the battle of Austerlitz, himself in the foreground giving his orders.
      This puts him in high spirits; he advances and salutes the governor, who
      receives him most loyally, gives him an entertainment, and, according to
      the usage of all epic hosts, insists after dinner on a full narration of
      all that has happened to him since the battle of Leipzic. </span>

      the form of an old woman, she here appears in the kindred shape of Mr.
      Vansittart, and in an impassioned address exhorts his lordship to war. His

      confederate kings. The poet, however, with a laudable zeal for the glory

      the linden-shadowed Elbe, and measured with his eye the skulls of all who
      walked through the streets of Berlin. Alas! his own skull is now cleft by
      the Corsican sword. Four pupils of the University of Jena advance together
      to encounter the Emperor; at four blows he destroys them all. Blucher
      rushes to arrest the devastation; Napoleon strikes him to the ground, and
      is on the point of killing him, but Gneisenau, Ziethen, Billow, and all
      the other heroes of the Prussian army, gather round him, and bear the

      assistance of Lord Hill. In the mean time the Duke makes a tremendous
      carnage among the French. He encounters General Duhesme and vanquishes
      him, but spares his life. He kills Toubert, who kept the gaming-house in
      the Palais Royal, and Maronet, who loved to spend whole nights in drinking
      champagne. Clerval, who had been hooted from the stage, and had then
      become a captain in the Imperial Guard, wished that he had still continued
      to face the more harmless enmity of the Parisian pit. But Larrey, the son
      of Esculapius, whom his father had instructed in all the secrets of his
      art, and who was surgeon-general of the French army, embraced the knees of

      primed by the Cyclops, wounds the Emperor in the thigh. He flies, and

      seating himself on the hearth of the Regent, embraces the household gods,
      and conjures him, by the venerable age of George III., and by the opening
      perfections of the Princess Charlotte, to spare him. The Prince is
      inclined to do so; when, looking on his breast, he sees there the belt of
      the Duke of Brunswick. He instantly draws his sword, and is about to stab
      the destroyer of his kinsman. Piety and hospitality, however, restrain his
      hand. He takes a middle course, and condemns Napoleon to be exposed on a

      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span><br />his is a book which
      enjoys a great and increasing popularity: but, while it has attracted a
      considerable share of the public attention, it has been little noticed by
      the critics. Mr. Mitford has almost succeeded in mounting, unperceived by
      those whose office it is to watch such aspirants, to a high place among
      historians. He has taken a seat on the dais without being challenged by a
      single seneschal. To oppose the progress of his fame is now almost a
      hopeless enterprise. Had he been reviewed with candid severity, when he
      had published only his first volume, his work would either have deserved
      its reputation, or would never have obtained it. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; as Indra says of
      Kehama, &ldquo;then was the time to strike.&rdquo; The time was neglected; and the
      consequence is that Mr. Mitford, like Kehama, has laid his victorious hand
      on the literary Amreeta, and seems about to taste the precious elixir of
      immortality. I shall venture to emulate the courage of the honest
      Glendoveer&mdash; </span>

      <br />

    <p>
      In plain words, I shall offer a few considerations, <span class="pagenum">173</span><a
      name="link173" id="link173"></a>which may tend to reduce an overpraised
      writer to his proper level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal characteristic of this historian, the origin of his
      excellencies and his defects, is a love of singularity. He has no notion
      of going with a multitude to do either good or evil. An exploded opinion,
      or an unpopular person, has an irresistible charm for him. The same
      perverseness may be traced in his diction. His style would never have been
      elegant; but it might at least have been manly and perspicuous; and
      nothing but the most elaborate care could possibly have made it so bad as
      it is. It is distinguished by harsh phrases, strange collocations,
      occasional solecisms, frequent obscurity, and, above all, by a peculiar
      oddity, which can no more be described than it can be overlooked. Nor is
      this all. Mr. Mitford piques himself on spelling better than any of his
      neighbours; and this not only in ancient names, which he mangles in
      defiance both of custom and of reason, but in the most ordinary words of
      the English language. It is, in itself, a matter perfectly indifferent
      whether we call a foreigner by the name which he bears in his own
      language, or by that which corresponds to it in ours; whether we say
      Lorenzo de Medici, or Lawrence de Medici, Jean Chauvin, or John Calvin. In
      such cases established usage is considered as law by all writers except
      Mr. Mitford. If he were always consistent with himself, he might be
      excused for sometimes disagreeing with his neighbours; but he proceeds on
      no principle but that of being unlike the rest of the world. Every child
      has heard of Linnæus; therefore Mr. Mitford calls him Linné: Rousseau is
      known all over Europe as Jean Jacques; therefore Mr. Mitford bestows on
      him the strange appellation of John James. <span class="pagenum">174</span><a
      name="link174" id="link174"></a>Had Mr. Mitford undertaken a history of
      any other country than Greece, this propensity would have rendered his
      work useless and absurd. His occasional remarks on the affairs of ancient
      Rome and of modern Europe are full of errors: but he writes of times with
      respect to which almost every other writer has been in the wrong; and,
      therefore, by resolutely deviating from his predecessors, he is often in
      the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost all the modern historians of Greece have shown the grossest
      ignorance of the most obvious phenomena of human nature. In their
      representations the generals and statesmen of antiquity are absolutely
      divested of all individuality. They are personifications; they are
      passions, talents, opinions, virtues, vices, but not men. Inconsistency is
      a thing of which these writers have no notion. That a man may have been
      liberal in his youth and avaricious in his age, cruel to one enemy and
      merciful to another, is to them utterly inconceivable. If the facts be
      undeniable, they suppose some, strange and deep design, in order to
      explain what, as every one who has observed his own mind knows, needs no
      explanation at all. This is a mode of writing very acceptable to the
      multitude who have always been accustomed to make gods and daemons out of
      men very little better or worse than themselves; but it appears
      contemptible to all who have watched the changes of human character&mdash;to
      all who have observed the influence of time, of circumstances, and of
      associates, on mankind&mdash;to all who have seen a hero in the gout, a
      democrat in the church, a pedant in love, or a philosopher in liquor. This
      practice of painting in nothing but black and white is unpardonable even
      in the drama. It is the great fault of Alfieri; <span class="pagenum">175</span><a
      name="link175" id="link175"></a>and how much it injures the effect of his
      compositions will be obvious to every one who will compare his Rosmunda
      with the Lady Macbeth of Shakspeare. The one is a wicked woman; the other
      is a fiend. Her only feeling is hatred; all her words are curses. We are
      at once shocked and fatigued by the spectacle of such raving cruelty,
      excited by no provocation, repeatedly changing its object, and constant in
      nothing but in its inextinguishable thirst for blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In history this error is far more disgraceful. Indeed, there is no fault
      which so completely ruins a narrative in the opinion of a judicious
      reader. We know that the line of demarcation between good and bad men is
      so faintly marked as often to elude the most careful investigation of
      those who have the best opportunities for judging. Public men, above all,
      are surrounded with so many temptations and difficulties that some doubt
      must almost always hang over their real dispositions and intentions. The
      lives of Pym, Cromwell, Monk, Clarendon, Marlborough, Burnet, Walpole, are
      well known to us. We are acquainted with their actions, their speeches,
      their writings; we have abundance of letters and well-authenticated
      anecdotes relating to them: yet what candid man will venture very
      positively to say which of them were honest and which of them were
      dishonest men. It appears easier to pronounce decidedly upon the great
      characters of antiquity, not because we have greater means of discovering
      truth, but simply because we have less means of detecting error. The
      modern historians of Greece have forgotten this. Their heroes and villains
      are as consistent in all their sayings and doings as the cardinal virtues
      and the deadly sins in an allegory. We should as soon expect a good action
      from giant Slaygood <span class="pagenum">176</span><a name="link176"
       id="link176"></a>in Bunyan as from Dionysius; and a crime of Epaminondas
      would seem as incongruous as a <i>faux-pas</i> of the grave and comely
      damsel, called Discretion, who answered the bell at the door of the house
      Beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      This error was partly the cause and partly the effect of the high
      estimation in which the later ancient writers have been held by modern
      scholars. Those French and English authors who have treated of the affairs
      of Greece have generally turned with contempt from the simple and natural
      narrations of Thucydides and Xenophon to the extravagant representations
      of Plutarch, Diodorus, Curtius, and other romancers of the same class,&mdash;men
      who described military operations without ever having handled a sword, and
      applied to the seditions of little republics speculations formed by
      observation on an empire which covered half the known world. Of liberty
      they knew nothing. It was to them a great mystery,&mdash;a superhuman
      enjoyment. They ranted about liberty and patriotism, from the same cause
      which leads monks to talk more ardently than other men about love and
      women. A wise man values political liberty, because it secures the persons
      and the possessions of citizens; because it tends to prevent the
      extravagance of rulers, and the corruption of judges; because it gives
      birth to useful sciences and elegant arts; because it excites the industry
      and increases the comforts of all classes of society. These theorists
      imagined that it possessed something eternally and intrinsically good,
      distinct from the blessings which it generally produced. They considered
      it not as a means but as an end; an end to be attained at any cost. Their
      favourite heroes are those who have sacrificed, for the mere name of
      freedom, the prosperity <span class="pagenum">177</span><a
      name="link177" id="link177"></a>&mdash;the security&mdash;the justice&mdash;from
      which freedom derives its value.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another remarkable characteristic of these writers, in which
      their modern worshippers have carefully imitated them,&mdash;a great
      fondness for good stories. The most established facts, dates, and
      characters are never suffered to come into competition with a splendid
      saying, or a romantic exploit. The early historians have left us natural
      and simple descriptions of the great events which they witnessed, and the
      great men with whom they associated. When we read the account which
      Plutarch and Rollin have given of the same period, we scarcely know our
      old acquaintance again; we are utterly confounded by the melo-dra-matic
      effect of the narration, and the sublime coxcombry of the characters. .
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the principal errors into which the predecessors of Mr. Mitford
      have fallen; and from most of these he is free. His faults are of a
      completely different description. It is to be hoped that the students of
      history may now be saved, like Dorax in Dryden&rsquo;s play, by swallowing two
      conflicting poisons, each of which may serve as an antidote to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first and most important difference between Mr. Mitford and those who
      have preceded him is in his narration. Here the advantage lies, for the
      most part, on his side. His principle is to follow the contemporary
      historians, to look with doubt on all statements which are not in some
      degree confirmed by them, and absolutely to reject all which are
      contradicted by them. While he retains the guidance of some writer in whom
      he can place confidence, he goes on excellently. When he loses it, he
      falls to the level, or perhaps below the level, of the writers whom he so
      much despises: he is <span class="pagenum">178</span><a name="link178"
       id="link178"></a>as absurd as they, and very much duller. It is really
      amusing to observe how be proceeds with his narration when he has no
      better authority than poor Diodorus. He is compelled to relate something;
      yet he believes nothing. He accompanies every fact with a long statement
      of objections. His account of the administration of Dionysius is in no
      sense a history. It ought to be entitled&mdash;&ldquo;Historic doubts as to
      certain events, alleged to have taken place in Sicily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This scepticism, however, like that of some great legal characters almost
      as sceptical as himself, vanishes whenever his political partialities
      interfere. He is a vehement admirer of tyranny and oligarchy, and
      considers no evidence as feeble which can be brought forward in favour of
      those forms of government. Democracy he hates with a perfect hatred, a
      hatred which, in the first volume of his history, appears only in his
      episodes and reflections, but which, in those parts where he has less
      reverence for his guides, and can venture to take his own way, completely
      distorts even his narration.
    </p>
    <p>
      In taking up these opinions, I have no doubt that Mr. Mitford was
      influenced by the same love of singularity which led him to spell <i>island</i>
      without an s, and to place two dots over the last letter of <i>idea</i>.
      In truth, preceding historians have erred so monstrously on the other side
      that even the worst parts of Mr. Mitford&rsquo;s book may be useful as a
      corrective. For a young gentleman who talks much about his country,
      tyrannicide, and Epaminondas, this work, diluted in a sufficient quantity
      of Rollin and Barthelemi, maybe a very useful remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The errors of both parties arise from an ignorance or a neglect of the
      fundamental principles of political science. The writers on one side
      imagine popular government <span class="pagenum">170</span><a
      name="link170" id="link170_"></a>to be always a blessing; Mr. Mitford
      omits no opportunity of assuring us that it is always a curse. The fact
      is, that a good government, like a good coat, is that which fits the body
      for which it is designed, A man who, upon abstract principles, pronounces
      a constitution to be good, without an exact knowledge of the people who
      are to be governed by it, judges as absurdly as a tailor who should
      measime the Belvidere Apollo for the clothes of all his customers. The
      demagogues who wished to see Portugal a republic, and the wise critics who
      revile the Virginians for not having instituted a peerage, appear equally
      ridiculous to all men of sense and candour.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is the best government which desires to make the people happy, and
      knows how to make them happy. Neither the inclination nor the knowledge
      will suffice alone; and it is difficult to find them together!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pure democracy, and pure democracy alone, satisfies the former condition
      of this great problem. That the governors may be solicitous only for the
      interests of the governed, it is necessary that the interests of the
      governors and the governed should be the same. This cannot be often the
      case where power is intrusted to one or to a few. The privileged part of
      the community will doubtless derive a certain degree of advantage from the
      general prosperity of the state; but they will derive a greater from
      oppression and exaction. The king will desire an useless war for his
      glory, or a <i>parc-aux-cerfs</i> for his pleasure. The nobles will demand
      monopolies and <i>lettres-de-câchet</i>. In proportion as the number of
      governors is increased the evil is diminished. There are fewer to
      contribute, and more to receive. The dividend which each can obtain of the
      public plunder becomes less and less tempting. But the interests <span
      class="pagenum">180</span><a name="link180" id="link180"></a>of the
      subjects and the rulers never absolutely coincide till the subjects
      themselves become the rulers, that is, till the government be either
      immediately or mediately democratical.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is not enough. &ldquo;Will without power,&rdquo; said the sagacious Casimir
      to Milor Beefington, &ldquo;is like children playing at soldiers.&rdquo; The people
      will always be desirous to promote their own interests; but it may be
      doubted, whether, in any community, they were ever sufficiently educated
      to understand them. Even in this island, where the multitude have long
      been better informed than in any other part of Europe, the rights of the
      many have generally been asserted against themselves by the patriotism of
      the few. Free trade, one of the greatest blessings which a government can
      confer on a people, is in almost every country unpopular. It may be well
      doubted, whether a liberal policy with regard to our commercial relations
      would find any support from a parliament elected by universal suffrage.
      The republicans on the other side of the Atlantic have recently adopted
      regulations of which the consequences will, before long, show us,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;How nations sink, by darling schemes
      oppressed, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">When vengeance listens to
      the fool&rsquo;s request.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The people are to be governed for their own good; and, that they may be
      governed for their own good, they must not be governed by their own
      ignorance. There are countries in which it would be as absurd to establish
      popular government as to abolish all the restraints in a school, or to
      untie all the strait-waistcoats in a madhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence it may be concluded that the happiest state of society is that in
      which supreme power resides in <span class="pagenum">181</span><a
      name="link181" id="link181"></a>the whole body of a well-informed people.
      This is an imaginary, perhaps an unattainable, state of things. Yet, in
      some measure, we may approximate to it; and he alone deserves the name of
      a great statesman, whose principle it is to extend the power of the people
      in proportion to the extent of their knowledge, and to give them every
      facility for obtaining such a degree of knowledge as may render it safe to
      trust them with absolute power. In the mean time, it is dangerous to
      praise or condemn constitutions in the abstract; since, from the despotism
      of St. Petersburg to the democracy of Washington, there is scarcely a form
      of government which might not, at least in some hypothetical case, be the
      best possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, however, there be any form of government which in all ages and all
      nations has always been, and must always be, pernicious, it is certainly
      that which Mr. Mitford, on his usual principle of being wiser than all the
      rest of the world, has taken under his especial patronage&mdash;pure
      oligarchy. This is closely, and indeed inseparably, connected with another
      of his eccentric tastes, a marked partiality for Lacedæmon, and a dislike
      of Athens. Mr. Mitford&rsquo;s book has, I suspect, rendered these sentiments in
      some degree popular; and I shall, therefore, examine them at some length.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shades in the Athenian character strike the eye more rapidly than
      those in the Lacedaemonian: not because they are darker, but because they
      are on a brighter ground. The law of ostracism is an instance of this.
      Nothing can be conceived more odious than the practice of punishing a
      citizen, simply and professedly, for his eminence;&mdash;and nothing in
      the institutions of Athens is more frequently or more justly censured.
      Lacedaemon; was free from this. And why? Lacedæmon <span class="pagenum">182</span><a
      name="link182" id="link182"></a>did not need it. Oligarchy is an ostracism
      of itself,&mdash;an ostracism not occasional, but permanent,&mdash;not
      dubious, but certain. Her laws prevented the development of merit, instead
      of attacking its maturity. They did not cut down the plant in its high and
      palmy state, but cursed the soil with eternal sterility. In spite of the
      law of ostracism, Athens produced, within a hundred and fifty years, the
      greatest public men that ever existed. Whom had Sparta to ostracise? She
      produced, at most, four eminent men, Brasidas, Gylip-pus, Lysander, and
      Agesilaus. Of these, not one rose to distinction within her jurisdiction.
      It was only when they escaped from the region within which the influence
      of aristocracy withered everything good and noble, it was only when they
      ceased to be Lacedæmonians, that they became great men. Brasidas, among
      the cities of Thrace, was strictly a democratical leader, the favourite
      minister and general of the people. The same may be said of Gylippus, at
      Syracuse. Lysander, in the Hellespont, and Agesilaus, in Asia, were
      liberated for a time from the hateful restraints imposed by the
      constitution of Lycurgus. Both acquired feme abroad; and both returned to
      be watched and depressed at home. This is not peculiar to Sparta.
      Oligarchy, wherever it has existed, has always stunted the growth of
      genius. Thus it was at Rome, till about a century before the Christian
      era: we read of abundance of consuls and dictators who won battles, and
      enjoyed triumphs; but we look in vain for a single man of the first order
      of intellect,&mdash;for a Pericles, a Demosthenes, or a Hannibal. The
      Gracchi formed a strong democratical party; Marius revived it; the
      foundations of the old aristocracy were shaken; and two generations
      fertile in really great men appeared. <span class="pagenum">183</span><a
      name="link183" id="link183"></a>Venice is a still more remarkable
      instance: in her history we see nothing but the state; aristocracy had
      destroyed every seed of genius and virtue. Her dominion was like herself,
      lofty and magnificent, but founded on filth and weeds. God forbid that
      there should ever again exist a powerful and civilised state, which, after
      existing through thirteen hundred eventful years, shall not bequeath to
      mankind the memory of one great name or one generous action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many writers, and Mr. Mitford among the number, have admired the stability
      of the Spartan institutions; in fact, there is little to admire, and less
      to approve. Oligarchy is the weakest and most stable of governments; and
      it is stable because it is weak. It has a sort of valetudinarian
      longevity; it lives in the balance of Sanctorius; it takes no exercise; it
      exposes itself to no accident; it is seized with an hypochondriac alarm at
      every new sensation; it trembles at every breath; it lets blood for every
      inflammation: and thus, without ever enjoying a day of health or pleasure,
      drags on its existence to a doting and debilitated old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spartans purchased for their government a prolongation of its
      existence by the sacrifice of happiness at home and dignity abroad. They
      cringed to the powerful; they trampled on the weak; they massacred their
      Helots; they betrayed their allies; they contrived to be a day too late
      for the battle of Marathon; they attempted to avoid the battle of Salamis;
      they suffered the Athenians, to whom they owed then-lives and liberties,
      to be a second time driven from their country by the Persians, that they
      might finish their own fortifications on the Isthmus; they attempted to
      take advantage of the distress to which exertions <span class="pagenum">184</span><a
      name="link184" id="link184"></a>in their cause had reduced their
      preservers, in order to make them their slaves; they strove to prevent
      those who had abandoned their walls to defend them, from rebuilding them
      to defend themselves; they commenced the Peloponnesian war in violation of
      their engagements with Athens; they abandoned it in violation of their
      engagements with their allies; they gave up to the sword whole cities
      which had placed themselves under their protection; they bartered, for
      advantages confined to themselves, the interest, the freedom, and the
      lives of those who had served them most faithfully; they took with equal
      complacency, and equal infamy, the stripes of Elis and the bribes of
      Persia; they never showed either resentment or gratitude; they abstained
      from no injury; and they revenged none. Above all, they looked on a
      citizen who served them well as their deadliest enemy. These are the arts
      which protract the existence of governments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were the domestic institutions of Lacedæmon less hateful or less
      contemptible than her foreign policy. A perpetual interference with every
      part of the system of human life, a constant struggle against nature and
      reason, characterised all her laws. To violate even prejudices which have
      taken deep root in the minds of a people is scarcely expedient; to think
      of extirpating natural appetites and passions is frantic: the external
      symptoms may be occasionally repressed; but the feeling still exists, and,
      debarred from its natural objects, preys on the disordered mind and body
      of its victim. Thus it is in convents&mdash;thus it is among ascetic sects&mdash;thus
      it was among the Lacedæmonians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence arose that madness, or violence approaching to madness, which, in
      spite of every external <span class="pagenum">185</span><a
      name="link185" id="link185"></a>restraint, often appeared among the most
      distinguished citizens of Sparta. Cleomenes terminated his career of
      raving cruelty by cutting himself to pieces. Pausanias seems to have been
      absolutely insane: he formed a hopeless and profligate scheme; he betrayed
      it by the ostentation of his behaviour, and the imprudence of his
      measures; and he alienated, by his insolence, all who might have served or
      protected him. Xenophon, a warm admirer of Lacedaemon, furnishes us with
      the strongest evidence to this effect. It is impossible not to observe the
      brutal and senseless fury which characterises almost every Spartan with
      whom he was connected. Clearchus nearly lost his life by his cruelty.
      Chirisophus deprived his army of the services of a faithful guide by his
      unreasonable and ferocious severity. But it is needless to multiply
      instances. Lycurgus, Mr. Mitford&rsquo;s favourite legislator, founded his whole
      system on a mistaken principle. He never considered that governments were
      made for men, and not men for governments. Instead of adapting the
      constitution to the people, he distorted the minds of the people to suit
      the constitution, a scheme worthy of the Laputan Academy of Projectors.
      And this appears to Mr. Mitford to constitute his peculiar title to
      admiration. Hear himself: &ldquo;What to modern eyes most strikingly sets that
      extraordinary man above all other legislators is, that in so many
      circumstances, apparently out of the reach of law, he controlled and
      formed to his own mind the wills and habits of his people.&rdquo; I should
      suppose that this gentleman had the advantage of receiving his education
      under the ferula of Dr. Pangloss; for his metaphysics are clearly those of
      the castle of Thunder-ten-tronckh: &ldquo;Remarquez bien epie les nez ont été
      faits pour porter des lunettes, <span class="pagenum">186</span><a
      name="link186" id="link186"></a>aussi avons nous des lunettes. Les jambes
      sont visiblement instituées pour être chaussées, et nous avons des
      chausses. Les cochons étant faits pour être mangés, nous mangeons du porc
      toute l&rsquo;année.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Athens the laws did not constantly interfere with the tastes of the
      people. The children were not taken from their parents by that universal
      step-mother, the state. They were not starved into thieves, or tortured
      into bullies; there was no established table at which every one must dine,
      no established style in which every one must converse. An Athenian might
      eat whatever he could afford to buy, and talk as long as he could find
      people to listen. The government did not tell the people what opinions
      they were to hold, or what songs they were to sing. Freedom produced
      excellence. Thus philosophy took its origin. Thus were produced those
      models of poetry, of oratory, and of the arts, which scarcely fall short
      of the standard of ideal excellence. Nothing is more conducive to
      happiness than the free exercise of the mind in pursuits congenial to it.
      This happiness, assuredly, was enjoyed far more at Athens than at Sparta.
      The Athenians are acknowledged even by their enemies to have been
      distinguished, in private life, by their courteous and amiable demeanour.
      Their levity, at least, was better then Spartan sullenness, and their
      impertinence, than Spartan insolence. Even in courage it may be questioned
      whether they were inferior to the Lacedæmonians. The great Athenian
      historian has reported a remarkable observation of the great Athenian
      minister. Pericles maintained that his countrymen, without submitting to
      the hardships of a Spartan education, rivalled all the achievements of
      Spartan valour, and that therefore the pleasures and <span class="pagenum">187</span><a
      name="link187" id="link187"></a>amusements which they enjoyed were to be
      considered as so much clear gain. The infantry of Athens was certainly not
      equal to that of Lacedæmon; but this seems to have been caused merely by
      want of practice; the attention of the Athenians was diverted from the
      discipline of the phalanx to that of the trireme. The Lacedæinonians, in
      spite of all their boasted valour, were, from the same cause, timid and
      disorderly in naval action.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are told that crimes of great enormity were perpetrated by the
      Athenian Government, and the democracies under its protection. It is true
      that Athens too often acted up to the full extent of the laws of war, in
      an age when those laws had not been mitigated by causes which have
      operated in later times. This accusation is, in fact, common to Athens, to
      Lacedæmon, to all the states of Greece, and to all states similarly
      situated. Where communities are very large, the heavier evils of war are
      felt but by few. The plough-boy sings, the spinning-wheel turns round, the
      wedding-day is fixed, whether the last battle were lost or won. In little
      states it cannot be thus; every man feels in his own property and person
      the effect of a war. Every man is a soldier, and a soldier fighting for
      his nearest interests. His own trees have been cut down&mdash;his own corn
      has been burnt&mdash;his own house has been pillaged&mdash;his own
      relations have been killed. How can he entertain towards the enemies of
      his country the same feelings with one who has suffered nothing; from
      them, except perhaps the addition of a small sum to the taxes which he
      pays. Men in such circumstances cannot be generous. They have too much at
      stake. It is when they are, if I may so express myself, playing for love,
      it is when war is a mere game at chess, it is when they are contending for
      a remote colony, a frontier town, <span class="pagenum">188</span><a
      name="link188" id="link188"></a>the honours of a flag, a salute, or a
      title, that they can make fine speeches, and do good offices to their
      enemies. The Black Prince waited behind the chair of his captive; Villars
      interchanged repartees with Eugene: George II. sent congratulations to
      Louis XV., during a war, upon occasion of his escape from the attempt of
      Damien: and these things are fine and generous, and very gratifying to the
      author of the Broad Stone of Honour, and all the other wise men who think,
      like him, that God made the world only for the use of gentlemen. But they
      spring in general from utter heartlessness. No war ought ever to be
      undertaken but under circumstances which render all interchange of
      courtesy between the combatants impossible. It is a bad thing that men
      should hate each other; but it is far worse that they should contract the
      habit of cutting one another&rsquo;s throats without hatred. War is never
      lenient, but where it is wanton; when men are compelled to fight in
      self-defence, they must hate and avenge: this may be bad; but it is human
      nature: it is the clay as it came from the hand of the potter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that among the dependencies of Athens seditions assumed a
      character more ferocious than even in France, during the reign of terror&mdash;the
      accursed Saturnalia of an accursed bondage. It is true that in Athens
      itself, where such convulsions were scarcely known, the condition of the
      higher orders was dis agreeable; that they were compelled to contribute
      large sums for the service or the amusement of the public; and that they
      were sometimes harassed by vexatious informers. Whenever such cases occur,
      Mr. Mitford&rsquo;s scepticism vanishes. The &ldquo;if,&rdquo; the &ldquo;but,&rdquo; the &ldquo;it is said,&rdquo;
       the &ldquo;if we may believe,&rdquo; with which he qualifies every charge against a
      tyrant or an aristocracy, are at <span class="pagenum">189</span><a
      name="link189" id="link189"></a>once abandoned. The blacker the story, the
      firmer is his belief; and he never fails to inveigh with hearty bitterness
      against democracy as the source of every species of crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Athenians, I believe, possessed more liberty than was good for them.
      Yet I will venture to assert that, while the splendour, the intelligence,
      and the energy of that great people were peculiar to themselves, the
      crimes with which they are charged arose from causes which were common to
      them with every other state which then existed. The violence of faction in
      that age sprung from a cause which has always been fertile in every
      political and moral evil, domestic slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of slavery is completely to dissolve the connection which
      naturally exists between the higher and lower classes of free citizens.
      The rich spend their wealth in purchasing and maintaining slaves. There is
      no demand for the labour of the poor; the fable of Menenius ceases to be
      applicable; the belly communicates no nutriment to the members; there is
      an atrophy in the body politic. The two parties, therefore, proceed to
      extremities utterly unknown in countries where they have mutually need of
      each other. In Rome the oligarchy was too powerful to be subverted by
      force; and neither the tribunes nor the popular assemblies, though
      constitutionally omnipotent, could maintain a successful contest against
      men who possessed the whole property of the state. Hence the necessity for
      measures tending; to unsettle the whole frame of society, and to take away
      every motive of industry; the abolition of debts, and the agrarian laws&mdash;propositions
      absurdly condemned by men who do not consider the circumstances from which
      they sprung. They were the desperate remedies of a desperate disease. In
      <span class="pagenum">190</span><a name="link190" id="link190"></a>Greece
      the oligarchical interest was not in general so deeply rooted as at Rome.
      The multitude, therefore, often redressed by force grievances which, at
      Rome, were commonly attacked under the forais of the constitution. They
      drove out or massacred the rich, and divided their property. If the
      superior union or military skill of the rich rendered them victorious,
      they took measures equally violent, disarmed all in whom they could not
      confide, often slaughtered great numbers and occasionally expelled the
      whole commonalty from the city, and remained, with their slaves, the sole
      inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      From such calamities Athens and Laeedæmon alone were almost completely
      free. At Athens the purses of the rich were laid under regular
      contribution for the support of the poor; and this, rightly considered,
      was as much a favour to the givers as to the receivers, since no other
      measure could possibly have saved their houses from pillage and their
      persons from violence. It is singular that Mr. Mitford should perpetually
      reprobate a policy which was the best that could be pursued in such a
      state of things, and which alone saved Athens from the frightful outrages
      which were perpetrated at Coreyra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lacedæmon, cursed with a system of slavery more odious than has ever
      existed in any other country, avoided this evil by almost totally
      annihilating private property. Lycurgus began by an agrarian law. He
      abolished all professions except that of arms; he made the whole of his
      community a standing army, every member of which had a common right to the
      services of a crowd of miserable bondmen; he secured the state from
      sedition at the expense of the Helots. Of all the parts of his system this
      is the most creditable to his head, and the most disgraceful to his heart.
      <span class="pagenum">191</span><a name="link191" id="link191"></a>These
      considerations, and many others of equal importance, Mr. Mitford lias
      neglected; but he has yet a heavier charge to answer. He has made not only
      illogical inferences, but false statements. While he never states, without
      qualifications and objections, the charges which the earliest and best
      historians have brought against his favourite tyrants, Pisistratus,
      Hip-pias, and Gelon, he transcribes, without any hesitation, the grossest
      abuse of the least authoritative writers against every democracy and every
      demagogue. Such an accusation should not be made without being supported;
      and I will therefore select one out of many passages which will fully
      substantiate the charge, and convict Mr. Mitford of wilful
      misrepresentation, or of negligence scarcely less culpable. Mr. Mitford is
      speaking of one of the greatest men that ever lived, Demosthenes, and
      comparing him with his rival, Æschines. Let him speak for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In earliest youth Demosthenes earned an opprobrious nickname by the
      effeminacy of his dress and manner.&rdquo; Does Mr. Mitford know that
      Demosthenes denied this charge, and explained the nickname in a perfectly
      different manner? (1) And if he knew it, should he not have stated it? He
      proceeds thus:&mdash;&ldquo;On emerging from minority, by the Athenian law, at
      five-and-twenty, he earned another opprobrious nickname by a prosecution
      of his guardians, which was considered as a dishonourable attempt to
      extort money from them.&rdquo; In the first place, Demosthenes was not
      five-and-twenty years of age. Mr. Mitford might have learned, from so
      common a book as the Archæologia of Archbishop Potter, that at twenty
      Athenian citizens were freed from the control of their guardians,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) See the speech of Æschines against Timarchus.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">192</span><a name="link192" id="link192"></a>and
      began to manage their own property. The very speech of Demosthenes against
      his guardians proves most satisfactorily that he was under twenty. In his
      speech against Midias, he says that when he undertook that prosecution he
      was quite a boy. His youth might, therefore, excuse the step, even if it
      had been considered, as Mr. Mitford says, a dishonourable attempt to
      extort money. But who considered it as such? «Not the judges, who
      condemned the guardians. The Athenian courts of justice were not the
      purest in the world; but their decisions were at least as likely to be
      just as the abuse of a deadly enemy. Mr. Mitford refers for confirmation
      of his statement to Æschines and Plutarch..Æschines by no means beat&rsquo;s him
      out; and Plutarch directly contradicts him. &ldquo;Hot long after,&rdquo; says Mr.
      Mitford, &ldquo;he took blows publicly in the theater&rdquo; (I preserve the
      orthography, if it can be so called, of this historian) &ldquo;from a petulant
      youth of rank, named Meidias.&rdquo; Here are two disgraceful mistakes. In the
      first place, it was long after; eight years at the very least, probably
      much more. In the next place, the petulant youth, of whom Mr. Mitford
      speaks, was fifty years old. (2) Really Mr. Mitford has less reason to
      censure the carelessness of his predecessors than to reform his own. After
      this monstrous inaccuracy, with regard to facts, we may be able to judge
      what degree of credit ought to be given to the vague abuse of such a
      writer. &ldquo;The cowardice of Demosthenes in the field afterwards became
      notorious.&rdquo; Demosthenes was a civil character; war was
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (2)Whoever will read the speech of Demosthenes against
     Midias will find the statements in the text confirmed, and
     will have, moreover, the pleasure of becoming acquainted
     with one of the finest compositions in the world.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">193</span><a name="link193" id="link193"></a>not
      his business. In his time the division between military and political
      offices was beginning to be strongly marked; yet the recollection of the
      days when every citizen was a soldier was still recent. In such states of
      society a certain degree of disrepute always attaches to sedentary men;
      but that any leader of the Athenian democracy could have been, as Mr.
      Mitford says of Demosthenes, a few lines before, remarkable for &ldquo;an
      extraordinary deficiency of personal courage,&rdquo; is absolutely impossible.
      What mercenary warrior of the time exposed his life to greater or more
      constant perils? Was there a single soldier at Chæronea who had more cause
      to tremble for his safety than the orator, who, in case of defeat, could
      scarcely hope for mercy from the people whom he had misled or the prince
      whom lie had opposed? Were not the ordinary fluctuations of popular
      feeling enough to deter any coward from engaging in political conflicts?
      Isocrates, whom Mr. Mitford extols, because he constantly employed all the
      flowers of his school-boy rhetoric to decorate oligarchy and tyranny,
      avoided the judicial and political meetings of Athens from mere timidity,
      and seems to have hated democracy only because he durst not look a popular
      assembly in the face. Demosthenes was a man of a feeble constitution: his
      nerves were weak; but his spirit was high: and the energy and enthusiasm
      of his feelings supported him through life and in death.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for Demosthenes. Now for the orator of aristocracy. I do not wish
      to abuse Æschines. He may have been an honest man. He was certainly a
      great man; and I feel a reverence, of which Mr. Mitford seems to have no
      notion, for great men of every party. But, when Mr. Mitford says that the
      private character <span class="pagenum">194</span><a name="link194"
       id="link194"></a>of Æscliines was without stain, does he remember what
      Æschines has himself confessed in his speech against Timarchus? I can make
      allowances, as well as Mr. Mitford, for persons who lived under a
      different system of laws and morals; but let them be made impartially. If
      Demosthenes is to be attacked on account of some childish improprieties,
      proved only by the assertion of an antagonist, what shall we say of those
      maturer vices which that antagonist has himself acknowledged? &ldquo;Against the
      private character of Æschines,&rdquo; says Mr. Mitford, &ldquo;Demosthenes seems not
      to have had an insinuation to oppose.&rdquo; Has Mr. Mitford ever read the
      speech of Demosthenes on the Embassy? Or can he have forgotten, what was
      never forgotten by any one else who ever read it, the story which
      Demosthenes relates with such terrible energy of language concerning the
      drunken brutality of his rival? True or false, here is something more than
      an insinuation; and nothing can vindicate the historian, who has
      overlooked it, from the charge of negligence or of partiality. But
      Æschines denied the story. And did not Demosthenes also deny the story
      respecting his childish nickname, which Mr. Mitford has nevertheless told
      without any qualification? But the judges, or some part of them, showed,
      by their clamour, their disbelief of the relation of Demosthenes. And did
      not the judges, who tried the cause between Demosthenes and his guardians,
      indicate, in a much clearer manner, their approbation of the prosecution?
      But Demosthenes was a demagogue, and is to be slandered. Æscliines was an
      aristocrat, and is to be panegyrised. Is this a history, or a party
      pamphlet?
    </p>
    <p>
      These passages, all selected from a single page of Mr. Mitford&rsquo;s work, may
      give some notion to those <span class="pagenum">195</span><a
      name="link195" id="link195"></a>readers, who have not the means of
      comparing his statements with the original authorities, of his extreme
      partiality and carelessness. Indeed, whenever this historian mentions
      Demosthenes, he violates all the laws of candour and even of decency; he
      weighs no authorities; he makes no allowances; he forgets the best
      authenticated facts in the history of the times, and the most generally
      recognised principles of human nature. The opposition of the great orator
      to the policy of Philip he represents as neither more nor less than
      deliberate villainy. I hold almost the same opinion with Mr. Mitford
      respecting the character and the views of that great and accomplished
      prince. But am I, therefore, to pronounce Demosthenes profligate and
      insincere? Surely not. Do we not perpetually see men of the greatest
      talents and the purest intentions misled by national or factious
      prejudices? The most respectable people in England were, little more than
      forty years ago, in the habit of uttering the bitterest abuse against
      Washington and Franklin. It is certainly to be regretted that men should
      err so grossly in their estimate of character. But no person who knows
      anything of human nature will impute such errors to depravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mitford is not more consistent with himself than with reason. Though
      he is the advocate of all oligarchies, he is also a warm admirer of all
      kings, and of all citizens who raised themselves to that species of
      sovereignty which the Greeks denominated tyranny. If monarchy, as Mr.
      Mitford holds, be in itself a blessing, democracy must be a better form of
      government than aristocracy, which is always opposed to the supremacy, and
      even to the eminence, of individuals. On the other hand, it is <span
      class="pagenum">196</span><a name="link196" id="link196"></a>but one
      step that separates the demagogue and the sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this article had not extended itself to so great a length, I should
      offer a few observations on some other peculiarities of this writer,&mdash;his
      general preference of the Barbarians to the Greeks,&mdash;his predilection
      for Persians, Carthaginians, Thracians, for all nations, in short, except
      that great and enlightened nation of which he is the historian. But I will
      confine myself to a single topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mitford has remarked, with truth and spirit, that &ldquo;any history
      perfectly written, but especially a Grecian history perfectly written,
      should be a political institute for all nations.&rdquo; It has not occurred to
      him that a Grecian history, perfectly written, should also be a complete
      record of the rise and progress of poetry, philosophy, and the arts. Here
      his work is extremely deficient. Indeed, though it may seem a strange
      thing to say of a gentleman who has published so many quartos, Mr. Mitford
      seems to entertain a feeling, bordering on contempt, for literary and
      speculative pursuits. The talents of action almost exclusively attract his
      notice; and he talks with very complacent disdain of &ldquo;the idle learned.&rdquo;
       Homer, indeed, he admires; but principally, I am afraid, because he is
      convinced that Homer could neither read nor write. He could not avoid
      speaking of Socrates; but he has been far more solicitous to trace his
      death to political causes, and to deduce from it consequences unfavourable
      to Athens, and to popular governments, than to throw light on the
      character and doctrines of the wonderful man,

      does not seem to be aware that Demosthenes was a great orator; he
      represents him sometimes as an aspiring demagogue, sometimes as an adroit
      negotiator, and always as a great rogue. But that in which the Athenian
      excelled all men of all ages, that irresistible eloquence, which at the
      distance of more than two thousand years stirs our blood, and brings tears
      into our eyes, he passes by with a few phrases of commonplace
      commendation. The origin of the drama, the doctrines of the sophists, the
      course of Athenian education, the state of the arts and sciences, the
      whole domestic system of the Greeks, he lias almost completely neglected.
      Yet these things will appear, to a reflecting man, scarcely less worthy of
      attention than the taking of Sphaeteria or the discipline of the
      targeteers of Iphierates.

      This, indeed, is a deficiency by no means peculiar to Mr. Mitford. Most
      people seem to imagine that a detail of public occurrences&mdash;the
      operations of sieges&mdash;the changes of administrations&mdash;the
      treaties&mdash;the conspiracies&mdash;the rebellions&mdash;is a complete
      history. Differences of definition are logically unimportant; but
      practically they sometimes produce the most momentous effects. Thus it has
      been in the present ease. Historians have, almost without exception,
      confined themselves to the public transactions of states, and have left to
      the negligent administration of writers of fiction a province at least
      equally extensive and valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      All wise statesmen have agreed to consider the prosperity or adversity of
      nations as made up of the happiness or misery of individuals, and to
      reject as chimerical all notions of a public interest of the community,
      distinct from the interest of the component parts. It <span class="pagenum">198</span><a
      name="link198" id="link198"></a>is therefore strange that those whose
      office it is to supply statesmen with examples and warnings should omit,
      as too mean for the dignity of history, circumstances which exert the most
      extensive influence on the state of society. In general, the under current
      of human life flows steadily on, unruffled by the storms which agitate the
      surface. The happiness of the many commonly depends on causes independent
      of victories or defeats, of revolutions or restorations,&mdash;causes
      which can be regulated by no laws, and which are recorded in no archives.
      These causes are the things which it is of main importance to us to know,
      not how the Lacedæmonian phalanx was broken at Leuctra&mdash;not whether
      Alexander died of poison or by diseased History, without these, is a shell
      without a kernel; and such is almost all the history which is extant in
      the world. Paltry skirmishes and plots are reported with absurd and
      useless minuteness; but improvements the most essential to the comfort of
      human life extend themselves over the world, and introduce themselves into
      every cottage, before any annalist can condescend, from the dignity of
      writing about generals and ambassadors, to take the least notice of them.
      Thus the progress of the most salutary inventions and discoveries is
      buried in impenetrable mystery; mankind are deprived of a most useful
      species of knowledge, and their benefactors of their honest fame. In the
      meantime every child knows by heart the dates and adventures of a long
      line of barbarian kings. The history of nations, in the sense in which I
      use the word, is often best studied in works not professedly historical.
      Thucydides, as far as he goes, is an excellent writer; yet he affords ns
      far less knowledge of the most important particulars relating <span
      class="pagenum">199</span><a name="link199" id="link199"></a>to
      Athens than Plato or Aristophanes. The little treatise of Xenophon on
      Domestic Economy contains more historical information than all the seven
      hooks of his Hellenics. The same may be said of the Satires of Horace, of
      the Letters of Cicero, of the novels of Le Sage, of the memoirs of Marin
      on tel. Many others might be mentioned; but these sufficiently illustrate
      my meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would hope that there may yet appear a writer who may despise the
      present narrow limits, and assert the &lsquo;rights of history over every part
      of her natural domain. Should such a writer engage in that enterprise, in
      which I cannot but consider Mr. Mitford as having failed, he will record,
      indeed, all that is interesting and important in military and political
      transactions; but he will not think anything too trivial for the gravity
      of history which is not too trivial to promote or diminish the happiness
      of man. He will portray in vivid colours the domestic society, the
      manners, the amusements, the conversation of the Greeks. He will not
      disdain to discuss the state of agriculture, of the mechanical arts, and
      of the conveniences of life. The progress of painting, of sculpture, and
      of architecture, will form an important part of his plan. But, above all,
      his attention will be given to the history of that splendid literature
      from which has sprung all the strength, the wisdom, the freedom, and the
      glory, of the western world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the indifference which Mr. Mitford shows on this subject I will not
      speak; for I cannot speak with fairness. It is a subject on which I love
      to forget the accuracy of a judge, in the veneration of a worshipper and
      the gratitude of a child. If we consider merely the subtlety of
      disquisition, the force of imagination, <span class="pagenum">200</span><a
      name="link200" id="link200"></a>the perfect energy and elegance of
      expression, which characterise the great works of Athenian genius, we must
      pronounce them intrinsically most valuable; but what shall we say when we
      reflect that from hence have sprung, directly or indirectly, all the
      noblest creations of the human intellect; that from hence were the vast
      accomplishments, and the brilliant fancy of Cicero; the withering fire of
      Juvenal; the plastic imagination of Dante; the humour of Cervantes; the
      comprehension of Bacon; the wit of Butler; the supreme and universal
      excellence of Shakspeare? All the triumphs of truth and genius over
      prejudice and power, in every country and in every age, have been the
      triumphs of Athens. Wherever a few great minds have made a stand against
      violence and fraud, in the cause of liberty and reason, there has been her
      spirit in the midst of them; inspiring, encouraging, consoling;&mdash;by
      the lonely lamp of Erasmus; by the restless bed of Pascal; in the tribune
      of Mirabeau; in the cell of Galileo; on the scaffold of Sidney. But who
      shall estimate her influence on private happiness? Who shall say how many
      thousands have been made wiser, happier, and better, by those pursuits in
      which she has taught mankind to engage; to how many the studies which took
      their rise from her have been wealth in poverty,&mdash;liberty in bondage,&mdash;health
      in sickness, &mdash;society in solitude? Her power is indeed manifested at
      the bar, in the senate, in the field of battle, in the schools of
      philosophy. But these are not her glory. Wherever literature consoles
      sorrow, or assuages pain,&mdash;wherever it brings gladness to eyes which
      fail with wakefulness and tears, and ache for the dark house and the long
      sleep,&mdash;there is exhibited, in its noblest form, the immortal
      influence of Athens. <span class="pagenum">201</span><a name="link201"
       id="link201"></a>The dervise, in the Arabian tale, did not hesitate to
      abandon to his comrade the camels with their load of jewels and gold,
      while he retained the casket of that mysterious juice which enabled him to
      behold at one glance all the hidden riches of the universe. Surely it is
      no exaggeration to say that no external advantage is to be compared with
      that purification of the intellectual eye which gives us to contemplate
      the infinite wealth of the mental world, all the hoarded treasures of its
      primeval dynasties, all the shapeless ore of its yet unexplored mines.
      This is the gift of Athens to man. Her freedom and her power have for more
      than twenty centuries been annihilated; her people have degenerated into
      timid slaves: her language into a barbarous jargon; her temples have been
      given up to the successive depredations of Romans, Turks, and Scotchmen;
      but her intellectual empire is imperishable. And when those who have
      rivalled her greatness shall have shared her fate; when civilisation and
      knowledge shall have fixed their abode in distant continents; when the
      sceptre shall have passed away from England; when, perhaps, travellers
      from distant regions shall in vain labour to decipher on some mouldering
      pedestal the name of our proudest chief; shall hear savage hymns chaunted
      to some misshapen idol, over the ruined dome of our proudest temple; and
      shall see a single naked fisherman wash his nets in the river of the ten
      thousand masts;&mdash;her influence and her glory will still survive,&mdash;fresh
      in eternal youth, exempt from mutability and decay, immortal as the
      intellectual principle from which they derived their origin, and over
      which they exercise their control.

      MILTON.(1)
    </h2>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">202</span><a name="link202" id="link202"></a>(<i>Edinburgh
      Review</i>, August 1825.) <br /> <span class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap"
        style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span><br />owards the close of the year 1823,
      Mr. Lemon, deputy keeper of the state papers, in the course of his
      researches among the presses of his office, met with a large Latin
      manuscript. With it were found corrected copies of the foreign despatches
      written by Milton, while he filled the office of Secretary, and several
      papers relating to the Popish Trials and the Rye-house Plot. The whole was
      wrapped up in an envelope, superscribed <i>To Mr. Skinner, Merchant</i>.
      On examination, the large manuscript proved to be the long lost Essay on
      the Doctrines of Christianity, which, according to Wood and Toland, Milton
      finished after the Restoration, and deposited with Cyriac Skinner.
      Skinner, it is well known, held the same political opinions with his
      illustrious friend. It is therefore probable, as Mr. Lemon conjectures,
      that he may have fallen under the suspicions of the government during that
      persecution of the Whigs which followed the dissolution of the Oxford
      parliament, and that, in consequence of a general seizure of his papers,
      this work may have been </span>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) <i>Jonnis Miltoni, Angli, de Doctrinâ Cliristicinâ libri
     duo posthumi</i>. A Treatise on Christian Doctrine, compiled
     from the Holy Scriptures alone, by John Milton, translated
     from the Original by Charles R. Sumner, M.A. &amp;c. &amp;c. 1825.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">203</span><a name="link203" id="link203"></a>brought
      to the office in which it has been found. But whatever the adventures of
      the manuscript may have been, no doubt can exist that it is a genuine
      relic of the great poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sumner, who was commanded by his Majesty to edite and translate the
      treatise, has acquitted himself of his task in a manner honourable to his
      talents and to his character. His version is not indeed very easy or
      elegant; but it is entitled to the praise of clearness and fidelity. His
      notes abound with interesting quotations, and have the rare merit of
      really elucidating the text. The preface is evidently the work of a
      sensible and candid man, firm in his own religious opinions, and tolerant
      towards those of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book itself will not add much to the fame of Milton. It is, like all
      his Latin works, well written, though not exactly in the style of the
      prize essays of Oxford and Cambridge. There is no elaborate imitation of
      classical antiquity, no scrupulous purity, none of the ceremonial
      cleanness which characterizes the diction of our academical Pharisees. The
      author does not attempt to polish and brighten his composition into the
      Ciceronian gloss and brilliancy. He does not in short sacrifice sense and
      spirit to pedantic refinements. The nature of his subject compelled him to
      use many words
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;That would have made Quintilian stare and
      gasp.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But he writes with as much ease and freedom as if Latin were his mother
      tongue; and, where he is least happy, his failure seems to arise from the
      carelessness of a native, not from the ignorance of a foreigner. We may
      apply to him what Denham with great felicity says of Cowley. He wears the
      garb, but not the clothes of the ancients. <span class="pagenum">204</span><a
      name="link204" id="link204"></a>Throughout the volume are discernible the
      traces of a powerful and independent mind, emancipated from the influence
      of authority, and devoted to the search of truth. Milton professes to form
      his system from the Bible alone; and his digest of scriptural texts is
      certainly among the best that have appeared. But he is not always so happy
      in his inferences as in his citations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the heterodox doctrines which he avows seemed to have excited
      considerable amazement, particularly his Arianism, and his theory on the
      subject of polygamy. Yet we can scarcely conceive that any person could
      have read the Paradise Lost without suspecting him of the former; nor do
      we think that any reader, acquainted with the history of his life, ought
      to be much startled at the latter. The opinions which he has expressed
      respecting the nature of the Deity, the eternity of matter, and the
      observation of the Sabbath, might, we think, have caused more just
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we will not go into the discussion of these points. The book, were it
      far more orthodox or far more heretical than it is, would not much edify
      or corrupt the present generation. The men of our time are not to be
      converted or perverted by quartos. A few more days, and this essay will
      follow the <i>Defensio Populi</i>, to the dust and silence of the upper
      shelf. The name of its author, and the remarkable circumstances attending
      its publication, will secure to it a certain degree of attention. For a
      month or two it will occupy a few minutes of chat in every drawing-room,
      and a few columns in every magazine; and it will then, to borrow the
      elegant language of the play-bills, be withdrawn, to make room for the
      forthcoming novelties. <span class="pagenum">205</span><a
      name="link205" id="link205"></a>We wish however to avail ourselves of the
      interest, transient as it may he, which this work has excited. The
      dexterous Capuchins never choose to preach on the life and miracles of a
      saint, till they have awakened the devotional feelings of their auditors
      by exhibiting some relic of him, a thread of his garment, a lock of his
      hair, or a drop of his blood. On the same principle, we intend to take
      advantage of the late interesting discovery, and, while this memorial of a
      great and good man is still in the hands of all, to say something of his
      moral and intellectual qualities. Nor, we are convinced, will the severest
      of our readers blame us if, on an occasion like the present, we turn for a
      short time from the topics of the day, to commemorate, in all love and
      reverence, the genius and virtues of John Milton, the poet, the statesman,
      the philosopher, the glory of English literature, the champion and the
      martyr of English liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is by his poetry that Milton is best known; and it is of his poetry
      that we wish first to speak. By the general suffrage of the civilised
      world, his place has been assigned among the greatest masters of the art.
      His detractors, however, though outvoted, have not been silenced. There
      are many critics, and some of great name, who contrive in the same breath
      to extol the poems and to decry the poet. The works they acknowledge,
      considered in themselves, may be classed among the noblest productions of
      the human mind. But they will not allow the author to rank with those
      great men who, born in the infancy of civilisation, supplied, by their own
      powers, the want of instruction, and, though destitute of models
      themselves, bequeathed to posterity models which defy imitation. Milton,
      it is said, inherited what his predecessors created: he lived <span
      class="pagenum">206</span><a name="link206" id="link206"></a>in an
      enlightened age; he received a finished education; and we must therefore,
      if we would form a just estimate of his powers, make large deductions in
      consideration of these advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      We venture to say, on the contrary, paradoxical as the remark may appear,
      that no poet has ever had to struggle with more unfavourable circumstances
      than Milton. He doubted, as he has himself owned, whether he had not been
      born &ldquo;an age too late.&rdquo; For this notion Johnson has thought fit to make
      him the butt of much clumsy ridicule. The poet, we believe, understood the
      nature of his art better than the critic. He knew that his poetical genius
      derived no advantage from the civilisation which surrounded him, or from
      the learning which he had acquired; and he looked back with something like
      regret to the ruder age of simple words and vivid impressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We think that, as civilisation advances, poetry almost necessarily
      declines. Therefore, though we fervently admire those great works of
      imagination which have appeared in dark ages, we do not admire them the
      more because they have appeared in dark ages. On the contrary, we hold
      that the most wonderful and splendid proof of genius is a great poem
      produced in a civilised age. We cannot understand why those who believe in
      that most orthodox article of literary faith, that the earliest poets are
      generally the best, should wonder at the rule as if it were the exception.
      Surely the uniformity of the phænomenon indicates a corresponding
      uniformity in the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is, that common observers reason from the progress of the
      experimental sciences to that of the imitative arts. The improvement of
      the former is gradual and slow. Ages are spent in collecting materiales
      <span class="pagenum">207</span><a name="link207" id="link207"></a>more
      in separating and combining them. Even when a system has been formed,
      there is still something to add, to alter, or to reject. Every generation
      enjoys the use of a vast hoard bequeathed to it by antiquity, and
      transmits that hoard, augmented by fresh acquisitions, to future ages. In
      these pursuits, therefore, the first speculators lie under great
      disadvantages, and, even when they fail, are entitled to praise. Their
      pupils, with far inferior intellectual powers, speedily surpass them in
      actual attainments. Every girl who has read Mrs. Marcet&rsquo;s little dialogues
      on Political Economy could teach Montague or Walpole many lessons in
      finance. Any intelligent man may now, by resolutely applying himself for a
      few years to mathematics, learn more than the great Newton knew after half
      a century of study and meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is not thus with music, with painting, or with sculpture. Still
      less is it thus with poetry. The progress of refinement rarely supplies
      these arts with better objects of imitation. It may indeed improve the
      instruments which are necessary to the mechanical operations of the
      musician, the sculptor, and the painter. But language, the machine of the
      poet, is best fitted for his purpose in its rudest state. Nations, like
      individuals, first perceive, and then abstract. They advance from
      particular images to general terms. Hence the vocabulary of an enlightened
      society is philosophical, that of a half-civilised people is poetical.
    </p>
    <p>
      This change in the language of men is partly the cause and partly the
      effect of a corresponding change in the nature of their intellectual
      operations, of a change by which science gains and poetry loses.
      Generalisation is necessary to the advancement of knowledge; but
      particularly is indispensable to the creations <span class="pagenum">208</span><a
      name="link208" id="link208"></a>of the imagination. In proportion as men
      know more and think more, they look less at individuals and more at
      classes. They therefore make better theories and worse poems. They give us
      vague phrases instead of images, and personified qualities instead of men.
      They may be better able to analyse human nature than their predecessors.
      But analysis is not the business of the poet. His office is to portray,
      not to dissect. He may believe in a moral sense, like Shaftesbury; he may
      refer all human actions to self-interest, like Helvetius; or he may never
      think about the matter at all. His creed on such subjects will no more
      influence his poetry, properly so called, than the notions which a painter
      may have conceived respecting the lacrymal glands, or the circulation of
      the blood, will affect the tears of his Niobe, or the blushes of his
      Aurora. If Shakespeare had written a book on the motives of human actions,
      it is by no means certain that it would have been a good one. It is
      extremely improbable that it would have contained half so much able
      reasoning on the sulbject as is to be found in the Fable of the Bees. But
      could Mandeville have created an Iago? Well as he knew how to resolve
      characters into their elements, would he have been able to combine those
      elements in such a manner as to make up a man, a real, living, individual
      man?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps no person can be a poet, or can even enjoy poetry, without a
      certain unsoundness of mind, if any thing which gives so much pleasure
      ought to be called unsoundness. By poetry we mean not all writing in
      verse, nor even all good writing in verse. Our definition excludes many
      metrical compositions which, on other grounds, deserve the highest praise.
      By poetry we mean the art of employing words in such a manner <span
      class="pagenum">209</span><a name="link209" id="link209"></a>as to
      produce an illusion on the imagination, the art of doing by means of words
      what the painter does by means of colours. Thus the greatest of poets has
      described it, in lines universally admired for the vigour and felicity of
      their diction, and still more valuable on account of the just notion which
      they convey of the art in which he excelled:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent25">&ldquo;As imagination bodies forth </span><br />
      <span class="indent15">The forms of things unknown, the poet&rsquo;s pen </span><br />
      <span class="indent15">Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
      </span><br /> <span class="indent15">A local habitation and a name.&rdquo;
       </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the fruits of the &ldquo;fine frenzy&rdquo; which he ascribes to the poet,&mdash;a
      fine frenzy doubtless, but still a frenzy. Truth, indeed, is essential to
      poetry; but it is the truth of madness. The reasonings are just; but the
      premises are false. After the first suppositions have been made, every
      thing ought to be consistent; but those first suppositions require a
      degree of credulity which almost amounts to a partial and temporary
      derangement of the intellect. Hence of all people children are the most
      imaginative. They abandon themselves without reserve to every illusion.
      Every image which is strongly presented to their mental eye produces on
      them the effect of reality. No man, whatever his sensibility may be, is
      ever affected by Hamlet or Lear, as a little girl is affected by the story
      of poor Red Riding-hood. She knows that it is all false, that wolves
      cannot speak, that there are no wolves in England. Yet in spite of her
      knowledge she believes; she weeps; she trembles; she dares not go into a
      dark room lest she should feel the teeth of the monster at her throat.
      Such is the despotism of the imagination over uncultivated minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a rude state of society men are children with a <span class="pagenum">210</span><a
      name="link210" id="link210"></a>greater variety of ideas. It is therefore
      in such a state of society that we may expect to find the poetical
      temperament in its highest perfection. In an enlightened age there will be
      much intelligence, much science, much philosophy, abundance of just
      classification and subtle analysis, abundance of wit and eloquence,
      abundance of verses, and even of good ones; but little poetry. Men will
      judge and compare; but they will not create. They will talk about the old
      poets, and comment on them, and to a certain degree enjoy them. But they
      will scarcely be able to conceive the effect which poetry produced on
      their ruder ancestors, the agony, the ecstasy, the plenitude of belief.
      The Greek Rhapsodists, according to Plato, could scarce recite Homer
      without falling into convulsions. The Mohawk hardly feels the scalping
      knife while he shouts his death-song. The power which the ancient bards of
      Wales and Germany exercised over their auditors seems to modern readers
      almost miraculous. Such feelings are very rare in a civilised community,
      and most rare among those who participate most in its improvements. They
      linger longest among the peasantry.

      Poetry produces an illusion on the eye of the mind, as a magic lantern
      produces an illusion on the eye of the body. And, as the magic lantern
      acts best in a dark room, poetry effects its purpose most completely in a
      dark age. As the light of knowledge breaks in upon its exhibitions, as the
      outlines of certainty become more and more definite and the shades of
      probability more and more distinct, the hues and lineaments&rsquo; of the
      phantoms which the poet calls up grow fainter and fainter. We cannot unite
      the incompatible advantages of reality and deception, the clear
      discernment of truth and the exquisite enjoyment of fiction. <span
      class="pagenum">211</span><a name="link211" id="link211"></a>He who,
      in an enlightened and literary society, aspires to be a great poet, must
      first become a little child. He must take to pieces the whole web of his
      mind. He must unlearn much of that knowledge which has perhaps constituted
      hitherto his chief title to superiority. His very talents will be a
      hindrance to him. His difficulties will be proportioned to his proficiency
      in the pursuits which are fashionable among his contemporaries; and that
      proficiency will in general be proportioned to the vigour and activity of
      his mind. And it is well if, after all his. sacrifices and exertions, his
      works do not resemble a lisping man or a modern ruin. We have seen in our
      own time great talents, intense labour, and long meditation, employed in
      this struggle against the spirit of the age, and employed, we will not say
      absolutely in vain, but with dubious success and feeble applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      If these reasonings be just, no poet has ever triumphed over greater
      difficulties than Milton. He received a learned education: he was a
      profound and elegant classical scholar: he had studied all the mysteries
      of Rabbinical literature: he was intimately acquainted with every language
      of modern Europe, from which either pleasure or information was then to be
      derived. He was perhaps the only great poet of later times who has been
      distinguished by the excellence of his Latin verse. The genius of Petrarch
      was scarcely of the first order; and his poems in the ancient language,
      though much praised by those who have never read them, are wretched
      compositions. Cowley, with all his admirable wit and ingenuity, had little
      imagination: nor indeed do we think his classical diction comparable to
      that of Milton. The authority of Johnson is against us on this point. But
      Johnson had studied <span class="pagenum">212</span><a name="link212"
       id="link212"></a>the bad writers of the middle ages till he had become
      utterly insensible to the Augustan elegance, and was as ill qualified to
      judge between two Latin styles as a habitual drunkard to set up for a
      wine-taster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Versification in a dead language is an exotic, a farfetched, costly,
      sickly, imitation of that which elsewhere may be found in healthful and
      spontaneous perfection. The soils on which this rarity flourishes are in
      general as ill suited to the production of vigorous native poetry as the
      flower-pots of a hot-house to the growth of oaks. That the author of the
      Paradise Lost should have written the Epistle to Manso was truly
      wonderful. Never before were such marked originality and such exquisite
      mimicry found together. Indeed in all the Latin poems of Milton the
      artificial manner indispensable to such works is admirably preserved,
      while, at the same time, his genius gives to them a peculiar charm, an air
      of nobleness and freedom, which distinguishes them from all other writings
      of the same class. They remind us of the amusements of those angelic
      warriors who composed the cohort of Gabriel:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;About him exercised heroic games </span><br />
      <span class="indent15">The unarmed youth of heaven. But o&rsquo;er their heads
      </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Celestial armoury, shield, helm, and
      spear, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Hung high, with diamond flaming
      and with gold.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot look upon the sportive exercises for which the genius of Milton
      ungirds itself, without catching la glimpse of the gorgeous and terrible
      panoply which it is accustomed to wear. The strength of his imagination
      triumphed over every obstacle. So intense and ardent was the fire of his
      mind, that it not only was not suffocated beneath the weight of fuel, but
      penetrated the whole superincumbent mass with its own heat and radiance.
      <span class="pagenum">213</span><a name="link213" id="link213"></a>It
      is not our intention to attempt any thing like a complete examination of
      the poetry of Milton. The public has long been agreed as to the merit of
      the most remarkable passages, the incomparable harmony of the numbers, and
      the excellence of that style, which no rival has been able to equal, and
      no parodist to degrade, which displays In their highest perfection the
      idiomatic powers of the English tongue, and to which every ancient and
      every modern language has contributed something of grace, of energy, or of
      music. In the vast field of criticism on which we are entering,
      innumerable reapers have already put their sickles. Yet the harvest is so
      abundant that the negligent search of a straggling gleaner may be rewarded
      with a sheaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most striking characteristic of the poetry of Milton is the extreme
      remoteness of the associations by means of which it acts on the reader.
      Its effect is produced, not so much by what it expresses, as by what it
      suggests; not so much by the ideas which it directly conveys, as by other
      ideas which are connected with them. He electrifies the mind through
      conductors. The most unimaginative man must understand the Iliad. Homer
      gives him no choice, and requires from him no exertion, but takes the
      whole upon himself, and sets the images in so clear a light, that it is
      impossible to be blind to them. The works of Milton cannot be comprehended
      or enjoyed, unless the mind of the reader co-operate with that of the
      writer. He does not paint a finished picture, or play for a mere passive
      listener. He sketches, and leaves others to fill up the outline. He
      strikes the key-note, and expects his hearer to make out the melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      We often hear of the magical influence of poetry. The expression in
      general means nothing: but applied <span class="pagenum">214</span><a
      name="link214" id="link214"></a>to the writings of Milton, it is most
      appropriate. His poetry acts like an incantation. Its merit lies less in
      its obvious meaning than in its occult power. There would seem, at first
      sight, to be no more in his words than in other words. But they are words
      of enchantment. No sooner are they pronounced, than the past is present
      and the distant near. New forms of beauty start at once into existence,
      and all the burial-places of the memory give up their dead. Change the
      structure of the sentence; substitute one synonyme for another, and the
      whole effect is destroyed. The spell loses its power; and he who should
      then hope to conjure with it would find himself as much mistaken as Cassim
      in the Arabian tale, when he stood crying, &ldquo;Open Wheat,&rdquo; &ldquo;Open Barley,&rdquo; to
      the door which obeyed no sound but &ldquo;Open Sesame.&rdquo; The miserable failure of
      Dryden in his attempt to translate into his own diction some parts of the
      Paradise Lost, is a remarkable instance of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      In support of these observations we may remark, that scarcely any passages
      in the poems of Milton are more generally known or more frequently
      repeated than those which are little more than muster-rolls of names. They
      are not always more appropriate or more melodious than other names. But
      they are charmed names. Every one of them is the first link in a long
      chain of associated ideas. Like the dwelling-place of our infancy
      revisited in manhood, like the song of our country heard in a strange
      land, they produce upon us an effect wholly independent of their intrinsic
      value. One transports us back to a remote period of history. Another
      places us among the novel scenes and manners of a distant region. A third
      evokes all the dear classical recollection of childhood, the school-room,
      <span class="pagenum">215</span><a name="link215" id="link215"></a>the
      dog-eared Virgil, the holiday, and the prize. A fourth brings before us
      the splendid phantoms of chivalrous romance, the trophied lists, the
      embroidered housings, the quaint devices, the haunted forests, the
      enchanted gardens, the achievements of enamoured knights, and the smiles
      of rescued princesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In none of the works of Milton is his peculiar manner more happily
      displayed than in the Allegro and the Penseroso. It is impossible to
      conceive that the mechanism of language can be brought to a more exquisite
      degree of perfection. These poems differ from others, as atar of roses
      differs from ordinary rose water, the close packed essence from the thin
      diluted mixture. They are indeed not so much poems, as collections of
      hints, from each of which the reader is to make out a poem for himself.
      Every epithet is a text for a stanza.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Comus and the Sampson Agonistes are works which, though of very
      different merit, offer some marked points of resemblance. Both are lyric
      poems in the form of plays. There are perhaps no two kinds of composition
      so essentially dissimilar as the drama and the ode. The business of the
      dramatist is to keep himself out of sight, and to let nothing appear but
      his characters. As soon as he attracts notice to his personal feelings,
      the illusion is broken. The effect is as unpleasant as that which is
      produced on the stage by the voice of a prompter or the entrance of a
      scene-shifter. Hence it was, that the tragedies of Byron were his least
      successful performances. They resemble those pasteboard pictures invented
      by the friend of children, Mr. Newbery, in which a single moveable head
      goes round twenty different bodies, so that the same face looks out upon
      us successively, from the uniform of a hussar, the furs of a judge, and
      the rags of a beggar. <span class="pagenum">216</span><a
      name="link216" id="link216"></a>In all the characters, patriots and
      tyrants, haters and lovers, the frown and sneer of Harold were discernible
      in an instant. But this species of egotism, though fatal to the drama, is
      the inspiration of the ode. It is the part of the lyric poet to abandon
      himself, without reserve, to his own emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between these hostile elements many great men have endeavoured to effect
      an amalgamation, but never with complete success. The Greek Drama, on the
      model of which the Samson was written, sprang from the Ode. The dialogue
      was ingrafted on the chorus, and naturally partook of its character. The
      genius of the greatest of the Athenian dramatists co-operated with the
      circumstances under which tragedy made its first appearance. Æschylus was,
      head and heart, a lyric poet. In his time, the Greeks had far more
      intercourse with the East than in the days of Homer; and they had not yet
      acquired that immense superiority in war, in science, and in the arts,
      which, in the following generation, led them to treat the Asiatics with
      contempt. From the narrative of Herodotus it should seem that they still
      looked up, with the veneration of disciples, to Egypt and Assyria. At this
      period, accordingly, it was natural that the literature of Greece should
      be tinctured with the Oriental style. And that style, we think, is
      discernible in the works of Pindar and Æschylus. The latter often reminds
      us of the Hebrew writers. The book of Job, indeed, in conduct and diction,
      bears a considerable resemblance to some of his dramas. Considered as
      plays, his works are absurd; considered as choruses, they are above all
      praise. If, for instance, we examine the address of Clytemnestra to
      Agamemnon on his return, or the description of the seven Argive chiefs, by
      the principles of dramatic <span class="pagenum">217</span><a
      name="link217" id="link217"></a>writing, we shall instantly condemn them
      as monstrous. But if we forget the characters, and think only of the
      poetry, we shall admit that it has never been surpassed in energy and
      magnificence. Sophocles made the Greek drama as dramatic as was consistent
      with its original form. His portraits of men have a sort of similarity;
      but it is the similarity not of a painting, but of a bas-relief. It
      suggests a resemblance; but it does not produce an illusion. Euripides
      attempted to carry the reform further. But it was a task far beyond his
      powers, perhaps beyond any powers. Instead of correcting what was bad, he
      destroyed what was excellent. He substituted crutches for stilts, bad
      sermons for good odes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milton, it is well known, admired Euripides highly, much more highly than,
      in our opinion, Euripides deserved. Indeed the caresses which this
      partiality leads our countryman to bestow on &ldquo;sad Electra&rsquo;s poet,&rdquo;
       sometimes remind us of the beautiful Queen of Fairy-land kissing the long
      ears of Bottom. At all events, there can be no doubt that this veneration
      for the Athenian, whether just or not, was injurious to the Samson
      Agonistes. Had Milton taken Æschylus for his model, he would have given
      himself up to the lyric inspiration, and poured out profusely all the
      treasures of his mind, without bestowing a thought on those dramatic
      proprieties which the nature of the work rendered it impossible to
      preserve. In the attempt to reconcile things in their own nature
      inconsistent, he has failed, as every one else must have failed. We cannot
      identify ourselves with the characters, as in a good play. We cannot
      identify ourselves with the poet, as in a good ode. The conflicting
      ingredients, like an acid and an alkali mixed, neutralise each other.
      <span class="pagenum">218</span><a name="link218" id="link218"></a>We
      are by no means insensible to the merits of this celebrated piece, to the
      severe dignity of the style, the graceful and pathetic solemnity of the
      opening speech, or the wild and barbaric melody which gives so striking an
      effect to the choral passages. But we think it, we confess, the least
      successful effort of the genius of Milton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Comus is framed on the model of the Italian Masque, as the Samson is
      framed on the model of the Greek Tragedy. It is certainly the noblest
      performance of the kind which exists in any language. It is as far
      superior to the Faithful Shepherdess, as the Faithful Shepherdess is to
      the Aminta, or the Aminta to the Pastor Fido. It was well for Milton that
      he had here no Euripides to mislead him. He understood and loved the
      literature of modern Italy. But he did not feel for it the same veneration
      which he entertained for the remains of Athenian and Roman poetry,
      consecrated by so many lofty and endearing recollections. The faults,
      moreover, of his Italian predecessors were of a kind to which his mind had
      a deadly antipathy. He could stoop to a plain style, sometimes even to a
      bald style; but false brilliancy was his utter aversion. His muse had no
      objection to a russet attire; but she turned with disgust from the finery
      of Guarini, as tawdry and as paltry as the rags of a chimney-sweeper on
      May-day. Whatever ornaments she wears are of massive gold, not only
      dazzling to the sight, but capable of standing the severest test of the
      crucible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milton attended in the Comus to the distinction which he afterwards
      neglected in the Samson. He made his Masque what it ought to be,
      essentially lyrical, and dramatic only in semblance. He has not <span
      class="pagenum">219</span><a name="link219" id="link219"></a>attempted
      a fruitless struggle against a defect inherent In the nature of that
      species of composition; and he has therefore succeeded, wherever success
      was not impossible. The speeches must be read as majestic soliloquies; and
      he who so reads them will be enraptured with their eloquence, their
      sublimity, and their music. The interruptions of the dialogue, however,
      impose a constraint upon the writer, and break the illusion of the reader.
      The finest passages are those which are lyric in form as well as in
      spirit. &ldquo;I should much commend,&rdquo; says the excellent Sir Henry Wotton in a
      letter to Milton, &ldquo;the tragical part if the lyrical did not ravish me with
      a certain Dorique delicacy in your songs and odes, whereunto, I must
      plainly confess to you, I have seen yet nothing parallel in our language.&rdquo;
       The criticism was just. It is when Milton escapes from the shackles of the
      dialogue, when he is discharged from the labour of uniting two incongruous
      styles, when he is at liberty to indulge his choral raptures without
      reserve, that he rises even above himself. Then, like his own good Genius
      bursting from the earthly form and weeds of Thyrsis, he stands forth in
      celestial freedom and beauty; he seems to cry exultingly,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent20">&ldquo;Now my task is smoothly done, </span><br />
      <span class="indent20">I can fly or I can run,&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      to skim the earth, to soar above the clouds, to bathe in the Elysian dew
      of the rainbow, and to inhale the balmy smells of nard and cassia, which
      the musky winds of the zephyr scatter through the cedared alleys of the
      Hesperides.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several of the minor poems of Milton on which we would willingly
      make a few remarks. Still more willingly would we enter into a detailed
      examination <span class="pagenum">220</span><a name="link220"
       id="link220"></a>of that admirable poem, the Paradise Regained, which,
      strangely enough, is scarcely ever mentioned except as an instance of the
      blindness of the parental affection which men of letters bear towards the
      offspring of their intellects. That Milton was mistaken in preferring this
      work, excellent as it is, to the Paradise Lost, we readily admit. But we
      are sure that the superiority of the Paradise Lost to the Paradise
      Regained is not more decided, than the superiority of the Paradise
      Regained to every poem which has since made its appearance. Our limits,
      however, prevent us from discussing the point at length. We hasten on to
      that extraordinary production which the general suffrage of critics has
      placed in the highest class of human compositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only poem of modern times which can be compared with the Paradise Lost
      is the Divine Comedy. The subject of Milton, in some points, resembled
      that of Dante; but he has treated it in a widely different manner. We
      cannot, we think, better illustrate our opinion respecting our own great
      poet, than by contrasting him with the father of Tuscan literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poetry of Milton differs from that of Dante, as the hieroglyphics of
      Egypt differed from the picturewriting of Mexico. The images which Dante
      employs speak for themselves; they stand simply for what they are. Those
      of Milton have a signification which is often discernible only to the
      initiated. Their value depends less on what they directly represent than
      on what they remotely suggest. However strange, however grotesque, may be
      the appearance which Dante undertakes to describe, he never shrinks from
      describing it. He gives us the shape, the colour, the sound, the smell,
      the taste; he counts the numbers; he measares <span class="pagenum">221</span><a
      name="link221" id="link221"></a>the size. His similes are the
      illustrations of a traveller. Unlike those of other poets, and especially
      of Milton, they are introduced in a plain, business-like manner; not for
      the sake of any beauty in the objects from which they are drawn; not for
      the sake of any ornament which they may impart to the poem; but simply in
      order to make the meaning of the writer as clear to the reader as it is to
      himself. The ruins of the precipice which led from the sixth to the
      seventh circle of hell were like those of the rock which fell into the
      Adige on the south of Trent. The cataract of Phlegethon was like that of
      Aqua Cheta at the monastery of St. Benedict. The place where the heretics
      were confined in burning tombs resembled the vast cemetery of Arles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let us compare with the exact details of Dante the dim intimations of
      Milton. We will cite a few examples. The English poet has never thought of
      taking the measure of Satan. He gives us merely a vague idea of vast bulk.
      In one passage the fiend lies stretched out huge in length, floating many
      a rood, equal in size to the earth-born enemies of Jove, or to the
      sea-monster which the mariner mistakes for an island. When he addresses
      himself to battle against the guardian angels, he stands like Teneriffe or
      Atlas: his stature reaches the sky. Contrast with these descriptions the
      lines in which Dante has described the gigantic spectre of Nimrod. &ldquo;His
      face seemed to me as long and as broad as the ball of St. Peter&rsquo;s at Rome;
      and his other limbs were in proportion; so that the bank, which concealed
      him from the waist downwards, nevertheless showed so much of him, that
      three tall Germans would in vain have attempted to reach to his hair.&rdquo; We
      are sensible that we do no <span class="pagenum">222</span><a
      name="link222" id="link222"></a>justice to the admirable style of the
      Florentine poet. But Mr. Cary&rsquo;s translation is not at hand; and our
      version, however rude, is sufficient to illustrate our meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, compare the lazar-house in the eleventh book of the Paradise
      Lost with the last ward of Malebolge in Dante. Milton avoids the loathsome
      details, and takes refuge in indistinct but solemn and tremendous imagery,
      Despair hurrying from couch to couch to mock the wretches with his
      attendance, Death shaking his dart over them, but, in spite of
      supplications, delaying to strike. What says Dante? &ldquo;There was such a moan
      there as there would be if all the sick who, between July and September,
      are in the hospitals of Valdichiana, and of the Tuscan swamps, and of
      Sardinia, were in one pit together; and such a stench was issuing forth as
      is wont to issue from decayed limbs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We will not take upon ourselves the invidious office of settling
      precedency between two such writers. Each in his own department is
      incomparable; and each, we may remark, has wisely, or fortunately, taken a
      subject adapted to exhibit his peculiar talent to the greatest advantage.
      The Divine Comedy is a personal narrative. Dante is the eye-witness and
      ear-witness of that which he relates. He is the very man who has heard the
      tormented spirits crying out for the second death, who has read the dusky
      characters on the portal within which there is no hope, who has hidden his
      face from the terrors of the Gorgon, who has fled from the hooks and the
      seething pitch of Barbariccia and Drag-hignazzo. His own hands have
      grasped the shaggy sides of Lucifer. His own feet have climbed the
      mountain of expiation. His own brow has been <span class="pagenum">223</span><a
      name="link223" id="link223"></a>marked by the purifying angel. The reader
      would throw aside such a tale in incredulous disgust, unless it were told
      with the strongest air of veracity, with a sobriety even in its horrors,
      with the greatest precision and multiplicity in its details. The narrative
      of Milton in this respect differs from that of Dante, as the adventures of
      Amadis differ from those of Gulliver. The author of Amadis would have made
      his book ridiculous if he had introduced those minute particulars which
      give such a charm to the work of Swift, the nautical observations, the
      affected delicacy about names, the official documents transcribed at foil
      length, and all the unmeaning gossip and scandal of the court, springing
      out of nothing, and tending to nothing. We are not shocked at being told
      that a man who lived, nobody knows when, saw many very strange sights, and
      we can easily abandon ourselves to the illusion of the romance. But when
      Lemuel Gulliver, surgeon, resident at Rotherhithe, tells us of pygmies and
      giants, flying islands, and philosophising horses, nothing but such
      circumstantial touches could produce for a single moment a deception on
      the imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the poets who have introduced into their works the agency of
      supernatural beings, Milton has succeeded best. Here Dante decidedly
      yields to him: and as this is a point on which many rash and
      ill-considered judgments have been pronounced, we feel inclined to dwell
      on it a little longer. The most fatal error which a poet can possibly
      commit in the management of his machinery, is that of attempting to
      philosophise too much. Milton has been often censured for ascribing to
      spirits many functions of which spirits must be incapable. But these
      objections, though sanctioned by eminent names, originate, we venture to
      say, in profound ignorance of the art of poetry. <span class="pagenum">224</span><a
      name="link224" id="link224"></a>What is spirit? What are our own minds,
      the portion of spirit with which we are best acquainted? We observe
      certain phænomena. We cannot explain them into material causes. We
      therefore infer that there exists something which is not material. But of
      this something we have no idea. We can define it only in negatives. We can
      reason about it only by symbols. We use the word: but we have no more of
      the things; and the business of poetry is with images, and not with words.
      The poet uses words indeed; but they are merely the instruments of his
      art, not its objects. They are the materials which he is to dispose in
      such a manner as to present a picture to the mental eye. And if they are
      not so disposed, they are no more entitled to be called poetry than a bale
      of canvas and a box of colours to be called a painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Logicians may reason about abstractions. But the great mass of men must
      have images. The strong tendency of the multitude in all a^es and nations
      to idolatry can be explained on no other principle. The first inhabitants
      of Greece, there is reason to believe, worshipped one invisible Deity. But
      the necessity of having something more definite to adore produced, in a
      few centuries, the innumerable crowd of Gods and Goddesses. In like manner
      the ancient Persians thought it impious to exhibit the Creator under a
      human form. Yet even these transferred to the Sun the worship which, in
      speculation, they considered due only to the Supreme Mind. The History of
      the Jews is the record of a continued struggle between pure Theism,
      supported by the most terrible sanctions, and the strangely fascinating
      desire of having some visible and tangible object of adoration. Perhaps
      none of the secondary causes which Gibbon has assigned for the rapidity
      with which Christianity spread over the world, <span class="pagenum">225</span><a
      name="link225" id="link225"></a>while Judaism scarcely ever acquired a
      proselyte, operated more powerfully than this feeling. God, the uncreated,
      the incomprehensible, the invisible, attracted few worshippers. A
      philosopher might admire so noble a conception: but the crowd turned away
      in disgust from words which presented no image to their minds. It was
      before Deity embodied in a human form, walking among men, partaking of
      their infirmities, leaning on their bosoms, weeping over their graves,
      slumbering in the manger, bleeding on the cross, that the prejudices of
      the Synagogue, and the doubts of the Academy, and the pride of the
      portico, and the fasces of the Lictor, and the swords of thirty legions,
      were humbled in the dust. Soon after Christianity had achieved its
      triumph, the principle which had assisted it began to corrupt it. It
      became a new Paganism. Patron saints assumed the offices of household
      gods. St. George took the place of Mars. St. Elmo consoled the mariner for
      the loss of Castor and Pollux. The Virgin Mother and Cecilia succeeded to
      Venus and the Muses. The fascination of sex and loveliness was again
      joined to that of celestial dignity; and the homage of chivalry was
      blended with that of religion. Reformers have often made a stand against
      these feelings; but never with more than apparent and partial success. The
      men who demolished the images in Cathedrals have not always been able to
      demolish those which were enshrined in their minds. It would not be
      difficult to show that in politics the same rule holds good. Doctrines, we
      are afraid, must generally be embodied before they can excite a strong
      public feeling. The multitude is more easily interested for the most
      unmeaning badge, or the most insignificant name, than for the most
      important principle. <span class="pagenum">226</span><a name="link226"
       id="link226"></a>From these considerations, we infer that no poet, who
      should affect that metaphysical accuracy for the want of which Milton has
      been blamed, would escape a disgraceful failure. Still, however, there was
      another extreme, which, though far less dangerous, was also to be avoided.
      The imaginations of men are in a groat measure under the control of their
      opinions. The most exquisite art of poetical colouring can produce no
      illusion, when it is employed to represent that which is at once perceived
      to be incongruous and absurd. Milton wrote in an age of philosophers and
      theologians. It was necessary, therefore, for him to abstain from giving
      such a shock to their understandings as might break the charm which it was
      his object to throw over their imaginations. This is the real explanation
      of the indistinctness and inconsistency with which he has often been
      reproached. Dr. Johnson acknowledges that it was absolutely necessary that
      the spirit should be clothed with material forms. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the
      poet should have secured the consistency of his system by keeping
      immateriality out of sight, and seducing the reader to drop it from his
      thoughts.&rdquo; This is easily said; but what if Milton could not seduce his
      readers to drop immateriality from their thoughts? What if the contrary
      opinion had taken so full a possession of the minds of men as to leave no
      room even for the half belief which poetry requires? Such we suspect to
      have been the case. It was impossible for the poet to adopt altogether the
      material or the immaterial system. He therefore took his stand on the
      debatable ground. He left the whole in ambiguity. He has, doubtless, by so
      doing, laid himself open to the charge of inconsistency. But, though
      philosophically in the wrong, we cannot but believe that he was poetically
      <span class="pagenum">227</span><a name="link227" id="link227"></a>in
      the right. This task, which almost any other writer would have found
      impracticable, was easy to him. The peculiar art which he possessed of
      communicating his meaning circuitously through a long succession of
      associated ideas, and of intimating more than he expressed, enabled him to
      disguise those incongruities which he could not avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poetry which relates to the beings of another world ought to be at once
      mysterious and picturesque. That of Milton is so. That of Dante is
      picturesque indeed beyond any that ever was written. Its effect approaches
      to that produced by the pencil or the chisel. But it is picturesque to the
      exclusion of all mystery. This is a fault on the right side, a fault
      inseparable from the plan of Dante&rsquo;s poem, which, as we have already
      observed, rendered the utmost accuracy of description necessary. Still it
      is a fault. The supernatural agents excite an interest; but it is not the
      interest which is proper to supernatural agents. We feel that we could
      talk to the ghosts and dæmons without any emotion of unearthly awe. We
      could, like Don Juan, ask them to supper, and eat heartily in their
      company. Dante&rsquo;s angels are good men with wings. His devils are spiteful
      ugly executioners. His dead men are merely living men in strange
      situations. The scene which passes between the poet and Farinata is justly
      celebrated. Still, Farinata in the burning tomb is exactly what Farinata
      would have been at an <i>auto da fe</i>. Nothing can be more touching than
      the first interview of Dante and Beatrice. Yet what is it, but a lovely
      woman chiding, with sweet austere composure, the lover for whose affection
      she is grateful, but whose vices she reprobates? The feelings which give
      the passage its charm would suit the streets of <span class="pagenum">228</span><a
      name="link228" id="link228"></a>Florence as well as the summit of the
      Mount of Purgatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirits of Milton are unlike those of almost all other writers. His
      fiends, in particular, are wonderful creations. They are not metaphysical
      abstractions. They are not wicked men. They are not ugly beasts. They have
      no horns, no tails, none of the fee-faw-fum of Tasso and Klopstock. They
      have just enough in common with human nature to be intelligible to human
      beings. Their characters are, like their forms, marked by a certain dim
      resemblance to those of men, but exaggerated to gigantic dimensions, and
      veiled in mysterious gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the gods and dæmons of Æschylus may best bear a comparison with
      the angels and devils of Milton. The style of the Athenian had, as we have
      remarked, something of the Oriental character; and the same peculiarity
      may be traced in his mythology. It has nothing of the amenity and elegance
      which we generally find in the superstitions of Greece. All is rugged,
      barbaric, and colossal. The legends of Æschylus seem to harmonize less
      with the fragrant groves and graceful porticoes in which his countrymen
      paid their vows to the God of Light and Goddess of Desire, than with those
      huge and grotesque labyrinths of eternal granite in which Egypt enshrined
      her mystic Osiris, or in which Hindostan still bows down to her
      seven-headed idols. His favourite gods are those of the elder generation,
      the sons of heaven and earth, compared with whom Jupiter himself was a
      stripling and an upstart, the gigantic Titans, and the inexorable Furies.
      Foremost among his creations of this class stands Prometheus, half fiend,
      half redeemer, the friend of man, the sullen and implacable enemy of
      heaven. Prometheus <span class="pagenum">229</span><a name="link229"
       id="link229"></a>bears undoubtedly a considerable resemblance, to the
      Satan of Milton. In both we find the same impatience of control, the same
      ferocity, the same unconquerable pride. In both characters also are
      mingled, though in very different proportions, some kind and generous
      feelings. Prometheus, however, is hardly superhuman enough. He talks too
      much of his chains and his uneasy posture: he is rather too much depressed
      and agitated. His resolution seems to depend on the knowledge which he
      possesses that he holds the fate of his torturer in his hands, and that
      the hour of his release will surely come. But Satan is a creature of
      another sphere. The might of his intellectual nature is victorious over
      the extremity of pain. Amidst agonies which cannot be conceived without
      horror, he deliberates, resolves, and even exults. Against the sword of
      Michael, against the thunder of Jehovah, against the flaming lake, and the
      marl burning with solid fire, against the prospect of an eternity of
      unintermitted misery, his spirit bears up unbroken, resting on its own
      innate energies, requiring no support from any thing external, nor even
      from hope itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return for a moment to the parallel which we have been attempting to
      draw between Milton and Dante, we would add that the poetry of these great
      men has in a considerable degree taken its character from their moral
      qualities. They are not egotists. They rarely obtrude their idiosyncrasies
      on their readers. They have, nothing in common with those modern beggars
      for fame, who extort a pittance from the compassion of the inexperienced
      by exposing the nakedness and sores of their minds. Yet it would be
      difficult to name two writers whose works have been more completely,
      though undesignedly, coloured by their personal feelings. <span
      class="pagenum">230</span><a name="link230" id="link230"></a>The
      character of Milton was peculiarly distinguished by loftiness of spirit;
      that of Dante by intensity of feeling. In every line of the Divine Comedy
      we discern the asperity which is produced by pride struggling with misery.
      There is perhaps no work in the world so deeply and uniformly sorrowful.
      The melancholy of Dante was no fantastic caprice. It was not, as far as at
      this distance of time can be judged, the effect of external circumstances.
      It was from within. Neither love nor glory, neither the conflicts of earth
      nor the hope of heaven could dispel it. It turned every consolation and
      every pleasure into its own nature. It resembled that noxious Sardinian
      soil of which the intense bitterness is said to have been perceptible even
      in its honey. His mind was, in the noble language of the Hebrew poet, &ldquo;a
      land of darkness, as darkness itself, and where the light was as
      darkness.&rdquo; The gloom of his character discolours all the passions of men,
      and all the face of nature, and tinges with its own livid hue the flowers
      of Paradise and the glories of the eternal throne. All the portraits of
      him are singularly characteristic. No person can look on the features,
      noble even to ruggedness, the dark furrows of the cheek, the haggard and
      woful stare of the eye, the sullen and contemptuous curve of the lip, and
      doubt that they belong to a man too proud and too sensitive to be happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milton was, like Dante, a statesman and a lover; and, like Dante, he had
      been unfortunate in ambition and in love. He had survived his health and
      his sight, the comforts of his home, and the prosperity of his party. Of
      the great men by whom he had been distinguished at his entrance into life,
      some had been taken away from the evil to come; some had carried into
      foreign climates their unconquerable hatred of oppression; <span
      class="pagenum">231</span><a name="link231" id="link231"></a>some
      were pining in dungeons; and some had poured forth their blood on
      scaffolds. Venal and licentious scribblers, with just sufficient talent to
      clothe the thoughts of a pandar in the style of a bellman, were now the
      favourite writers of the Sovereign and of the public. It was a loathsome
      herd, which could be compared to nothing so fitly as to the rabble of
      Cornus, grotesque monsters, half bestial half human, dropping with wine,
      bloated with gluttony, and reeling in obscene dances. Amidst these that
      fair Muse was placed, like the chaste lady of the Masque, lofty, spotless,
      and serene, to be chattered at, and pointed at, and grinned at, by the
      whole rout of Satyrs and Goblins. If ever despondency and asperity could
      be excused in any man, they might have been excused in Milton. But the
      strength of his mind overcame every calamity. Neither blindness, nor gout,
      nor age, nor penury, nor domestic afflictions, nor political
      disappointments, nor abuse, nor proscription, nor neglect, had power to
      disturb his sedate and majestic patience. His spirits do not seem to have
      been high, but they were singularly equable. His temper was serious,
      perhaps stern; but it was a temper which no sufferings could render sullen
      or fretful. Such as it was when, on the eve of great events, he returned
      from his travels, in the prime of health and manly beauty, loaded with
      literary distinctions, and glowing with patriotic hopes, such it continued
      to be when, after having experienced every calamity which is incident to
      our nature, old, poor, sightless and disgraced, he retired to his hovel to
      die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence it was that, though he wrote the Paradise Lost at a time of life
      when images of beauty and tenderness are in general beginning to fade,
      even from those minds in which they have not been effaced by <span
      class="pagenum">232</span><a name="link232" id="link232"></a>anxiety
      and disappointment, he adorned it with all that is most lovely and
      delightful in the physical and in the moral world. Neither Theocritus nor
      Ariosto had a finer or a more healthful sense of the pleasantness of
      external objects, or loved better to luxuriate amidst sunbeams and
      flowers, the songs of nightingales, the juice of summer fruits, and the
      coolness of shady fountains. His conception of love unites all the
      voluptuousness of the Oriental harem, and all the gallantry of the
      chivalric tournament, with all the pure and quiet affection of an English
      fireside. His poetry reminds us of the miracles of Alpine scenery. Nooks
      and dells, beautiful as fairy land, are embosomed in its most rugged and
      gigantic elevations. The roses and myrtles bloom unchilled on the verge of
      the avalanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traces, indeed, of the peculiar character of Milton may be found in all
      his works; but it is most strongly displayed in the Sonnets. Those
      remarkable poems have been undervalued by critics who have not understood
      their nature. They have no epigrammatic point. There is none of the
      ingenuity of Filicaja in the thought, none of the hard and brilliant
      enamel of Petrarch in the style. They are simple but majestic records of
      the feelings of the poet; as little tricked out for the public eye as his
      diary would have been. A victory, an expected attack upon the city, a
      momentary fit of depression or exultation, a jest thrown out against one
      of his books, a dream which for a short time restored to him that
      beautiful face over which the grave had closed for ever, led him to
      musings, which, without effort, shaped themselves into verse. The unity of
      sentiment and severity of style which characterise these little pieces
      remind us of the Greek Anthology, or perhaps still more of the Collects of
      the <span class="pagenum">233</span><a name="link233" id="link233"></a>English
      Liturgy. The noble poem on the Massacres of Piedmont is strictly a Collect
      in verse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sonnets are more or less striking, according as the occasions which
      gave birth to them are more or less interesting. But they are, almost
      without exception, dignified by a sobriety and greatness of mind to which
      we know not where to look for a parallel. It would, indeed, be scarcely
      safe to draw any decided inferences as to the character of a writer from
      passages directly egotistical. But the qualities which we have ascribed to
      Milton, though perhaps most strongly marked in those parts of his works
      which treat of his personal feelings, are distinguishable in every page,
      and impart to all his writings, prose and poetry, English, Latin, and
      Italian, a strong family likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His public conduct was such as was to be expected from a man of a spirit
      so high and of an intellect so powerful. He lived at one of the most
      memorable eras in the history of mankind, at the very crisis of the great
      conflict between Oromasdes and Arimanes, liberty and despotism, reason and
      prejudice. That great battle was fought for no single generation, for no
      single land. The destinies of the human race were staked on the same cast
      with the freedom of the English people. Then were first proclaimed those
      mighty principles which have since worked their way into the depths of the
      American forests, which have roused Greece from the slavery and
      degradation of two thousand years, and which, from one end of Europe to
      the other, have kindled an unquenchable fire in the hearts of the
      oppressed, and loosed the knees of the oppressors with an unwonted fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of those principles, then struggling for their infant existence, Milton
      was the most devoted and eloquent literary <span class="pagenum">234</span><a
      name="link234" id="link234"></a>champion. We need not say how much we
      admire his public conduct. But we cannot disguise from ourselves that a
      large portion of his countrymen still think it unjustifiable. The civil
      war, indeed, has been more discussed, and is less understood, than any
      event in English history. The friends of liberty laboured under the
      disadvantage of which the lion in the fable complained so bitterly. Though
      they were the conquerors, their enemies were the painters. As a body, the
      Roundheads had done their utmost to decry and ruin literature; and
      literature was even with them, as, in the long run, it always is with its
      enemies. The best book on their side of the question is the charming
      narrative of Mrs. Hutchinson. May&rsquo;s History of the Parliament is good; but
      it breaks off at the most interesting crisis of the struggle. The
      performance of Ludlow is foolish and violent; and most of the later
      writers who have espoused the same cause, Oldmixon for instance, and
      Catherine Macaulay, have, to say the least, been more distinguished by
      zeal than either by candour or by skill. On the other side are the most
      authoritative and the most popular historical works in our language, that
      of Clarendon, and that of Hume. The former is not only ably written and
      full of valuable information, but has also an air of dignity and sincerity
      which makes even the prejudices and errors with which it abounds
      respectable. Hume, from whose fascinating narrative the great mass of the
      reading public are still contented to take their opinions, hated religion
      so much that he hated liberty for having been allied with religion, and
      has pleaded the cause of tyranny with the dexterity of an advocate while
      affecting the impartiality of a judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public conduct of Milton must be approved or <span class="pagenum">235</span><a
      name="link235" id="link235"></a>condemned according as the resistance of
      the people to Charles the First shall appear to be justifiable or
      criminal. We shall therefore make no apology for dedicating a few pages to
      the discussion of that interesting and most important question. We shall
      not argue it on general grounds. We shall not recur to those primary
      principles from which the claim of any government to the obedience of its
      subjects is to be deduced. We are entitled to that vantage ground; but we
      will relinquish it. We are, on this point, so confident of superiority,
      that we are not unwilling to imitate the ostentatious generosity of those
      ancient knights, who vowed to joust without helmet or shield against all
      enemies, and to give their antagonists the advantage of sun and wind. We
      will take the naked constitutional question. We confidently affirm, that
      every reason which can be urged in favour of the Revolution of 1688 may be
      urged with at least equal force in favour of what is called the Great
      Rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one respect, only, we think, can the warmest admirers of Charles
      venture to say that he was a better sovereign than his son. He was not, in
      name and profession, a Papist; we say in name and profession, because both
      Charles himself and his creature Laud, while they abjured the innocent
      badges of Popery, retained all its worst vices, a complete subjection of
      reason to authority, a weak preference of form to substance, a childish
      passion for mummeries, an idolatrous veneration for the priestly
      character, and, above all, a merciless intolerance. This, however, we
      waive. We will concede that Charles was a good Protestant; but we say that
      his Protestantism does not make the slightest distinction between his case
      and that of James.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principles of the Revolution have often been <span class="pagenum">236</span><a
      name="link236" id="link236"></a>grossly misrepresented, and never more
      than in the course of the present year. There is a certain class of men,
      who, while they profess to hold in reverence the great names and great
      actions of former times never look at them for any other purpose than in
      order to find in them some excuse for existing abuses. In every venerable
      precedent they pass by what is essential, and take only what is
      accidental: they keep out of sight what is beneficial, and hold up to
      public imitation all that is defective. If, in any part of any great
      example, there be any thing unsound, these flesh-flies detect it with an
      unerring instinct, and dart upon it with a ravenous delight. If some good

      To the blessings which England has derived from the Revolution these
      people are utterly insensible. The expulsion of a tyrant, the solemn
      recognition of popular rights, liberty, security, toleration, all go for
      nothing with them. One sect there was, which, from unfortunate temporary
      causes, it was thought necessary to keep under close restraint. One part
      of the empire there was so unhappily circumstanced, that at that time its
      misery was necessary to our happiness, and its slavery to our freedom.
      These are the parts of the Revolution which the politicians of whom we
      speak, love to contemplate, and which seem to them not indeed to
      vindicate, but in some degree to palliate, the good which it has produced.
      Talk to them of Naples, of Spain, or of South America. They stand forth
      zealots for the doctrine of Divine Right which has now come back to us,
      like a thief from transportation, <span class="pagenum">237</span><a
      name="link237" id="link237"></a>under the <i>alias</i> of Legitimacy. But
      mention the miseries of Ireland. Then William is a hero. Then Somers and
      Shrewsbury are great men. Then the Revolution is a glorious era. The very
      same persons who, in this country, never omit an opportunity of reviving
      every wretched Jacobite slander respecting the Whigs of that period, have
      no sooner crossed St. George&rsquo;s Channel, than they begin to fill their
      bumpers to the glorious and immortal memory. They may truly boast that
      they look not at men, but at measures. So that evil be done, they care not
      who does it; the arbitrary Charles, or the liberal William, Ferdinand the
      Catholic, or Frederic the Protestant. On such occasions their deadliest
      opponents may reckon upon their candid construction. The bold assertions
      of these people have of late impressed a large portion of the public with
      an opinion that James the Second was expelled simply because he was a
      Catholic, and that the Revolution was essentially a Protestant Revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this certainly was not the case; nor can any person who has acquired
      more knowledge of the history of those times than is to be found in
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s Abridgment believe that, if James had held his own religious
      opinions without wishing to make proselytes, or if, wishing even to make
      proselytes, he had contented himself with exerting only his constitutional
      influence for that purpose, the Prince of Orange would ever have been
      invited over. Our ancestors, we suppose, knew their own meaning; and, if
      we may believe them, their hostility was primarily not to popery, but to
      tyranny. They did not drive out a tyrant because he was a Catholic; but
      they excluded Catholics from the crown, because they thought them likely
      <span class="pagenum">238</span><a name="link238" id="link238"></a>to
      be tyrants. The ground on which they, in their famous resolution, declared
      the throne vacant, was this, &ldquo;that James had broken the fundamental laws
      of the kingdom.&rdquo; Every man, therefore, who approves of the Revolution of
      1688 must hold that the breach of fundamental laws on the part of the
      sovereign justifies resistance. The question, then, is this; Had Charles
      the First broken the fundamental laws of England?
    </p>
    <p>
      No person can answer in the negative, unless he refuses credit, not merely
      to all the accusations brought against Charles by his opponents, but to
      the narratives of the warmest Royalists, and to the confessions of the
      King himself. If there be any truth in any historian of any party who has
      related the events of that reign, the conduct of Charles, from his
      accession to the meeting of the Long Parliament, had been a continued
      course of oppression and treachery. Let those who applaud the Revolution,
      and condemn the Rebellion, mention one act of James the Second to which a
      parallel is not to be found in the history of his father. Let them lay
      their fingers on a single article in the Declaration of Right, presented
      by the two Houses to William and Mary, which Charles is not acknowledged
      to have violated. He had, according to the testimony of his own friends,
      usurped the functions of the legislature, raised taxes without the consent
      of parliament, and quartered troops on the people in the most illegal and
      vexatious manner. Not a single session of parliament had passed without
      some unconstitutional attack on the freedom of debate; the right of
      petition was grossly violated; arbitrary judgments, exorbitant fines, and
      unwarranted imprisonments, were grievances of daily occurrence. If these
      things do not justify resistance, <span class="pagenum">239</span><a
      name="link239" id="link239"></a>the Revolution was treason; if they do,
      the Great Rebellion was laudable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, it is said, why not adopt milder measures? Why, after the King had
      consented to so many reforms, and renounced so many oppressive
      prerogatives, did the parliament continue to rise in their demands at the
      risk of provoking a civil war? The ship-money had been given up. The Star
      Chamber had been abolished. Provision had been made for the frequent,
      convocation and secure deliberation of parliaments. Why not pursue an end
      confessedly good by peaceable and regular means? We recur again to the
      analogy of the Revolution. Why was James driven from the throne? Why was
      he not retained upon conditions? He too had offered to call a free
      parliament and to submit to its decision all the matters in dispute. Yet
      we are in the habit of praising our forefathers, who preferred a
      revolution, a disputed succession, a dynasty of strangers, twenty years of
      foreign and intestine war, a standing army, and a national debt, to the
      rule, however restricted, of a tried and proved tyrant. The Long
      Parliament acted on the same principle, and is entitled to the same
      praise. They could not trust the King. He had no doubt passed salutary
      laws; but what assurance was there that he would not break them? He had
      renounced oppressive prerogatives; but where was the security that he
      would not resume them? The nation had to deal with a man whom no tie could
      bind, a man who made and broke promises with equal facility, a man whose
      honour had been a hundred times pawned, and never redeemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, indeed, the Long Parliament stands on still stronger ground than the
      Convention of 1688. No action of James can be compared to the conduct of
      <span class="pagenum">240</span><a name="link240" id="link240"></a>Charles
      with respect to the Petition of Right. The Lords and Commons present him
      with a bill in which the constitutional limits of his power are marked
      out. He hesitates; he evades; at last he bargains to give his assent for
      five subsidies. The bill receives his solemn assent; the subsidies are
      voted; but no sooner is the tyrant relieved, than he returns at once to
      all the arbitrary measures which he had bound himself to abandon, and
      violates all the clauses of the very Act which he had been paid to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more than ten years the people had seen the rights which were theirs
      by a double claim, by immemorial inheritance and by recent purchase,
      infringed by the perfidious king who had recognised them. At length
      circumstances compelled Charles to summon another parliament: another
      chance was given to our fathers: were they to throw it away as they had
      thrown away the former? Were they again to be cozened by le Roi le vent?
      Were they again to advance their money on pledges which had been forfeited
      over and over again? Were they to lay a second Petition of Right at the
      foot of the throne, to grant another lavish aid in exchange for another
      unmeaning ceremony, and then to take their departure, till, after ten
      years more of fraud and oppression, their prince should again require a
      supply, and again repay it with a perjury? They were compelled to choose
      whether they would trust a tyrant or conquer him. We think that they chose
      wisely and nobly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advocates of Charles, like the advocates of other malefactors against
      whom overwhelming evidence is produced, generally decline all controversy
      about the facts, and content themselves with calling testimony to
      character. He had so many private virtues! And <span class="pagenum">241</span><a
      name="link241" id="link241"></a>had James the Second no private virtues?
      Was Oliver Cromwell, his bitterest enemies themselves being judges,
      destitute of private virtues? And what, after all, are the virtues
      ascribed to Charles? A religious zeal, not more sincere than that of his
      son, and fully as weak and narrow-minded, and a few of the ordinary
      household decencies which half the tombstones in England claim for those
      who lie beneath them. A good father! A good husband! Ample apologies
      indeed for fifteen years of persecution, tyranny and falsehood!
    </p>
    <p>
      We charge him with having broken his coronation oath; and we are told that
      he kept his marriage vow! We accuse him of having given up his people to
      the merciless inflictions of the most hot-headed and hard-hearted of
      prelates; and the defence is, that he took his little son on his knee and
      kissed him! We censure him for having violated the articles of the
      Petition of Right, after having, for good and valuable consideration,
      promised to observe them; and we are informed that he was accustomed to
      hear prayers at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning! It is to such considerations
      as these, together with his Vandyke dress, his handsome face, and his
      peaked beard, that he owes, we verily believe, most of his popularity with
      the present generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ourselves, we own that we do not understand the common phrase, a good
      man, but a bad king. We can as easily conceive a good man and an unnatural
      father, or a good man and a treacherous friend. We cannot, in estimating
      the character of an individual, leave out of our consideration his conduct
      in the most important of all human relations; and if in that relation we
      find him to have been selfish, cruel, and deceitful, we shall take the
      liberty to call him a bad <span class="pagenum">242</span><a
      name="link242" id="link242"></a>man, in spite of all his temperance at
      table, and all his regularity at chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot refrain from adding a few words respecting a topic on which the
      defenders of Charles are fond of dwelling. If, they say, he governed his
      people ill, he at least governed them after the example of his
      predecessors. If he violated their privileges, it was because those
      privileges had not been accurately defined. No act of oppression has ever
      been imputed to him which has not a parallel in the annals of the Tudors.
      This point Hume has laboured, with an art which is as discreditable in a
      historical work as it would be admirable in a forensic address. The answer
      is short, clear, and decisive. Charles had assented to the Petition of
      Right. He had renounced the oppressive powers said to have been exercised
      by his predecessors, and he had renounced them for money He was not
      entitled to set up his antiquated claims against his own recent release.
    </p>
    <p>
      These arguments are so obvious, that it may seem superfluous to dwell upon
      them. But those who have observed how much the events of that time are
      misrepresented and misunderstood will not blame us for stating the case
      simply. It is a case of which the simplest statement is the strongest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemies of the Parliament, indeed, rarely choose to take issue on the
      great points of the question. They content themselves with exposing some
      of the crimes and follies to which public commotions necessarily give
      birth. They bewail the unmerited fate of Stafford. They execrate the
      lawless violence of the army. They laugh at the Scripitural names of the
      preachers. Major-generals fleecing their districts; soldiers revelling on
      the spoils of a ruined peasantry; upstarts, enriched by <span
      class="pagenum">243</span><a name="link243" id="link243"></a>the
      public plunder, taking possession of the hospitable firesides and
      hereditary trees of the old gentry; boys smashing the beautiful windows of
      cathedrals; Quakers riding naked through the market-place; Fifth-monarchy
      men shouting for King Jesus; agitators lecturing from the tops of tubs on
      the fate of Agag; all these, they tell us, were the offspring of the Great
      Rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be it so. We are not careful to answer in this matter. These charges, were
      they infinitely more important, would not alter our opinion of an event
      which alone has made us to differ from the slaves who crouch beneath
      despotic sceptres. Many evils, no doubt, were produced by the civil war.
      They were the price of our liberty. Has the acquisition been worth the
      sacrifice? It is the nature of the Devil of tyranny to tear and rend the
      body which he leaves. Are the miseries of continued possession less
      horrible than the struggles of the tremendous exorcism?
    </p>
    <p>
      If it were possible that a people brought up under an intolerant and
      arbitrary system could subvert that system without acts of cruelty and
      folly, half the objections to despotic power would be removed. We should,
      in that case, be compelled to acknowledge that it at least produces no
      pernicious effects on the intellectual and moral character of a nation. We
      deplore the outrages which accompany revolutions. But the more violent the
      outrages, the more assured we feel that a revolution was necessary. The
      violence of those outrages will always be proportioned to the ferocity and
      ignorance of the people; and the ferocity and ignorance of the people will
      be proportioned to the oppression and degradation under which they have
      been accustomed to live. Thus it was in our civil war. The heads of the
      church and state reaped only that <span class="pagenum">244</span><a
      name="link244" id="link244"></a>which they had sown. The government had
      prohibited free discussion: it had done its best to keep the people
      unacquainted with their duties and their rights. The retribution was just
      and natural. If our rulers suffered from popular ignorance, it was because
      they had themselves taken away the key of knowledge. If they were assailed
      with blind fury, it was because they had exacted an equally blind
      submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the character of such revolutions that we always see the worst of
      them at first. Till men have been some time free, they know not how to use
      their freedom. The natives of wine countries are generally sober. In
      climates where wine is a rarity intemperance abounds. A newly liberated
      people may be compared to a northern army encamped on the Rhine or the
      Xeres. It is said that, when soldiers in such a situation first find
      themselves able to indulge without restraint in such a rare and expensive
      luxury, nothing is to be seen but intoxication. Soon, however, plenty
      teaches discretion; and, after wine has been for a few months their daily
      fare, they become more temperate than they had ever been in their own
      country. In the same manner, the final and permanent fruits of liberty are
      wisdom, moderation, and mercy. Its immediate effects are often atrocious
      crimes, conflicting errors, scepticism on points the most clear, dogmatism
      on points the most mysterious. It is just at this crisis that its enemies
      love to exhibit it. They pull down the scaffolding from the half-finished
      edifice: they point to the flying dust, the falling bricks, the
      comfortless rooms, the frightful irregularity of the whole appearance; and
      then ask in scorn where the promised splendour and comfort is to be found.
      If such miserable sophisms were to prevail there would never be a good
      house or a good government in the world. <span class="pagenum">245</span><a
      name="link245" id="link245"></a>Ariosto tells a pretty story of a fairy,
      who, by some mysterious law of her nature, was condemned to appear at
      certain seasons in the form of a foul and poisonous snake. Those who
      injured her during the period of her disguise were for ever excluded from
      participation in the blessings which she bestowed. But to those who, in
      spite of her loathsome aspect, pitied and protected her, she afterwards
      revealed herself in the beautiful and celestial form which was natural to
      her, accompanied their steps, granted all their wishes, filled their
      houses with wealth, made them happy in love and victorious in war. Such a
      spirit is Liberty. At times she takes the form of a hateful reptile. She
      grovels, she hisses, she stings. But woe to those who in disgust shall
      venture to crush her! And happy are those who, having dared to receive her
      in her degraded and frightful shape, shall at length be rewarded by her in
      the time of her beauty and her glory!
    </p>
    <p>
      There is only one cure for the evils which newly acquired freedom
      produces; and that cure is freedom. When a prisoner first leaves his cell
      he cannot bear the light of day: he is unable to discriminate colours, or
      recognise faces. But the remedy is, not to remand him into his dungeon,
      but to accustom him to the rays of the sun. The blaze of truth and liberty
      may at first dazzle and bewilder nations which have become half blind in
      the house of bondage. But let them gaze on, and they will soon be able to
      bear it. In a few years men learn to reason. The extreme violence of
      opinions subsides. Hostile theories correct each other. The scattered
      elements of truth cease to contend, and begin to coalesce. And at length a
      system of justice and order is educed out of the chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many politicians of our time are in the habit of laying <span
      class="pagenum">246</span><a name="link246" id="link246"></a>it down
      as a self-evident proposition, that no people ought to be free till they
      are fit to use their freedom? The maxim is worthy of the fool in the old
      story who resolved not to go into the water till he had learnt to swim. If
      men are to wait for liberty till they become wise and good in slavery,
      they may indeed wait for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore it is that we decidedly approve of the conduct of Milton and the
      other wise and good men who, in spite of much that was ridiculous and
      hateful in the conduct of their associates, stood firmly by the cause of
      Public Liberty. We are not aware that the poet has been charged with
      personal participation in any of the blameable excesses of that time. The
      favourite topic of his enemies is the line of conduct which he pursued
      with regard to the execution of the King. Of that celebrated proceeding we
      by no means approve. Still we must say, in justice to the many eminent
      persons who concurred in it, and in justice more particularly to the
      eminent person who defended it, that nothing can be more absurd than the
      imputations which, for the last hundred and sixty years, it has been the
      fashion to cast upon the Regicides. We have, throughout, abstained from
      appealing to first principles. We will not appeal to them now. We recur
      again to the parallel case of the Revolution. What essential distinction
      can be drawn between the execution of the father and the deposition of the
      son? What constitutional maxim is there which applies to the former and
      not to the latter? The King can do no wrong. If so, James was as innocent
      as Charles could have been. The minister only ought to be responsible for
      the acts of the Sovereign. If so, why not impeach Jefferies and retain
      James? The person of a King is sacred. Was the person of <span
      class="pagenum">247</span><a name="link247" id="link247"></a>James
      considered sacred at the Boyne? To discharge cannon against an army in
      which a King is known to be posted is to approach pretty near to regicide.
      Charles, too, it should always be remembered, was put to death by men who
      had been exasperated by the hostilities of several years, and who had
      never been bound to him by any other tie than that which was common to
      them with all their fellow-citizens. Those who drove James from his
      throne, who seduced his army, who alienated his friends, who first
      imprisoned him in his palace, and then turned him out of it, who broke in
      upon his very slumbers by imperious messages, who pursued him with fire
      and sword from one part of the empire to another, who hanged, drew, and
      quartered his adherents, and attainted his innocent heir, were his nephew
      and his two daughters. When we reflect on all these things, we are at a
      loss to conceive how the same persons who, on the fifth of November, thank
      God for wonderfully conducting his servant William, and for making all
      opposition fall before him until he became our King and Governor, can, on
      the thirtieth of January, contrive to be afraid that the blood of the
      Royal Martyr may be visited on themselves and their children.
    </p>
    <p>
      We disapprove, we repeat, of the execution of Charles; not because the
      constitution exempts the King from responsibility, for we know that all
      such maxims, however excellent, have their exceptions; nor because we feel
      any peculiar interest in his character, for we think that his sentence
      describes him with perfect justice as &ldquo;a tyrant, a traitor, a murderer,
      and a public enemy;&rdquo; but because we are convinced that the measure was
      most injurious to the cause of freedom, He whom it removed was a captive
      and a hostage: his <span class="pagenum">248</span><a name="link248"
       id="link248"></a>heir, to whom the allegiance of every Royalist was
      instantly transferred, was at large. The Presbyterians could never have
      been perfectly reconciled to the father: they had no such rooted enmity to
      the son. The great body of the people, also, contemplated that proceeding
      with feelings which, however unreasonable, no government could safely
      venture to outrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though we think the conduct of the Regicides blameable, that of Milton
      appears to us in a very different light. The deed was done. It could not
      be undone. The evil was incurred; and the object was to render it as small
      as possible. We censure the chiefs of the army for not yielding to the
      popular opinion; but we cannot censure Milton for wishing to change that
      opinion. The very feeling which would have restrained us from committing
      the act would have led us, after it had been committed, to defend it
      against the ravings of servility and superstition. For the sake of public
      liberty, we wish that the thing had not been done, while the people
      disapproved of it. But, for the sake of public liberty, we should also
      have wished the people to approve of it when it was done. If any thing
      more were wanting to the justification of Milton, the book of Salmasius
      would furnish it. That miserable performance is now with justice
      considered only as a beacon to word-catchers, who wish to become
      statesmen. The celebrity of the man who refuted it, the &ldquo;Æneæ magni
      dextra,&rdquo; gives it all its fame with the present generation. In that age
      the state of things was different. It was not then fully understood how
      vast an interval separates the mere classical scholar from the political
      philosopher. Nor can it be doubted that a treatise which, bearing the name
      of so eminent a critic, attacked the fundamental principles of all free
      <span class="pagenum">249</span><a name="link249" id="link249"></a>governments,
      must, if suffered to remain unanswered, have produced a most pernicious
      effect on the public mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      We wish to add a few words relative to another subject, on which the
      enemies of Milton delight to dwell, his conduct during the administration
      of the Protector. That an enthusiastic votary of liberty should accept
      office under a military usurper seems, no doubt, at first sight,
      extraordinary. But all the circumstances in which the country was then
      placed were extraordinary. The ambition of Oliver was of no vulgar kind.
      He never seems to have coveted despotic power. He at first fought
      sincerely and manfully for the Parliament, and never deserted it, till it
      had deserted its duty. If he dissolved it by force, it was not till he
      found that the few members who remained after so many deaths, secessions,
      and expulsions, were desirous to appropriate to themselves a power which
      they held only in trust, and to inflict upon England the curse of a
      Venetian oligarchy. But even when thus placed by violence at the head of
      affairs, he did not assume unlimited power. He gave the country a
      constitution far more perfect than any which had at that time been known
      in the world. He reformed the representative system in a manner which has
      extorted praise even from Lord Clarendon. For himself he demanded indeed
      the first place in the commonwealth; but with powers scarcely so great as
      those of a Dutch stadtholder, or an American president. He gave the
      Parliament a voice in the appointment of ministers, and left to it the
      whole legislative authority, not even reserving; to himself a veto on its
      enactments; and he did not require that the chief magistracy should be
      hereditary in his family. Thus far, we think, if the circumstances of the
      time <span class="pagenum">250</span><a name="link250" id="link250"></a>and
      the opportunities which he had of aggrandizing himself he fairly
      considered, he will not lose by comparison with Washington or Bolivar. Had
      his moderation been met by corresponding moderation, there is no reason to
      think that he would have overstepped the line which he had traced for
      himself. But when he found that his parliaments questioned the authority
      under which they met, and that he was in danger of being deprived of the
      restricted power which was absolutely necessary to his personal safety,
      then, it must be acknowledged, he adopted a more arbitrary policy.

    <p>
      Yet, though we believe that the intentions of Cromwell were at first
      honest, though we believe that he was driven from the noble course which
      he had marked out for himself by the almost irresistible force of
      circumstances, though we admire, in common with all men of all parties,
      the ability and energy of his splendid administration, we are not pleading
      for arbitrary and lawless power, even in his hands. We know that a good
      constitution is infinitely better than the best despot. But we suspect,
      that at the time of which we speak, the violence of religious and
      political enmities rendered a stable and happy settlement next to
      impossible. The choice lay, not between Cromwell and liberty, but between
      Cromwell and the Stuarts. That Milton chose well, no man can doubt who
      fairly compares the events of the protectorate with those of the thirty
      years which succeeded it, the darkest and most disgraceful in the English
      annals. Cromwell was evidently laying, though in an irregular manner, the
      foundations of an admirable system. Never before had religious liberty and
      the freedom of discussion been enjoyed in a greater degree. Never had the
      national honour been better upheld abroad, or the seat of justice <span
      class="pagenum">251</span><a name="link251" id="link251"></a>better
      filled at home. And it was rarely that any opposition which stopped short
      of open rebellion provoked the resentment of the liberal and magnanimous
      usurper. The institutions which he had established, as set down in the
      Instrument of Government, and the Humble Petition and Advice, were
      excellent. His practice, it is true, too often departed from the theory of
      these institutions. But, had he lived a few years longer, it is probable
      that his institutions would have survived him, and that his arbitrary
      practice would have died with him. His power had not been consecrated by
      ancient prejudices. It was upheld only by his great personal qualities.
      Little, therefore, was to be dreaded from a second protector, unless he
      were also a second Oliver Cromwell. The events which followed his decease
      are the most complete vindication of those who exerted themselves to
      uphold his authority. His death dissolved the whole frame of society. The
      army rose against the parliament, the different corps of the army against
      each other. Sect raved against sect. Party plotted against party. The
      Presbyterians, in their eagerness to be revenged on the Independents,
      sacrificed their own liberty, and deserted all their old principles.
      Without casting one glance on the past, or requiring one stipulation for
      the future, they threw down their freedom at the feet of the most
      frivolous and heartless of tyrants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came those days, never to be recalled without a blush, the days of
      servitude without loyalty and sensuality without love, of dwarfish talents
      and gigantic vices, the paradise of cold hearts and narrow minds, the
      golden age of the coward, the bigot, and the slave. The King cringed to
      his rival that he might trample on his people, sank into a viceroy of
      France, and pocketed, <span class="pagenum">252</span><a
      name="link252" id="link252"></a>with complacent infamy, her degrading
      insults, and her more degrading gold. The caresses of harlots, and the
      jests of buffoons, regulated the policy of the state. The government had
      just ability enough to deceive, and just religion enough to persecute. The
      principles of liberty were the scoff of every grinning courtier, and the
      Anathema Maranatha of every fawning dean. In every high place, worship was
      paid to Charles and James, Belial and Moloch; and England propitiated
      those obscene and cruel idols with the blood of her best and bravest
      children. Crime succeeded to crime, and disgrace to disgrace, till the
      race accursed of God and man was a second time driven forth, to wander on
      the face of the earth, and to be a by-word and a shaking of the head to
      the nations.

      Most of the remarks which we have hitherto made on the public character of
      Milton, apply to him only as one of a large body. We shall proceed to
      notice some of the peculiarities which distinguished him from his
      contemporaries. And, for that purpose, it is necessary to take a short
      survey of the parties into which the political world was at that time
      divided. We must premise, that our observations are intended to apply only
      to those who adhered, from a sincere preference, to one or to the other
      side. In days of public commotion, every fiction, like an Oriental army,
      is attended by a crowd of camp-followers, an useless and heartless rabble,
      who prowl round its line of march in the hope of picking up something
      under its protection, but desert it in the day of battle, and often join
      to exterminate it after a defeat. England, at the time of which we are
      treating, abounded with fickle and selfish politicians, who transferred
      their support to every government as it rose, who kissed the hand of the
      King in 1640, and <span class="pagenum">253</span><a name="link253"
       id="link253"></a>spat in his face in 1649, who shouted with equal glee
      when Cromwell was inaugurated in Westminster Hall, and when he was dug up
      to be hanged at Tyburn, who dined on calves&rsquo; heads, or stuck up
      oak-branches, as circumstances altered, without the slightest shame or
      repugnance. These we leave out of the account. We take our estimate of
      parties from those who really deserve to be called partisans.
    </p>

      We would speak first of the Puritans, the most remarkable body of men,
      perhaps, which the world has ever produced. The odious and ridiculous
      parts of their character lie on the surface. He that runs may read them;
      nor have there been wanting attentive and malicious observers to point
      them out. For many years after the Restoration, they were the theme of
      unmeasured invective and derision. They were exposed to the utmost
      licentiousness of the press and of the stage, at the time when the press
      and the stage were most licentious. They were not men of letters; they
      were, as a body, unpopular; they could not defend themselves; and the
      public would not take them under its protection. They were therefore
      abandoned, without reserve, to the tender mercies of the satirists and
      dramatists. The ostentatious simplicity of their dress, their sour aspect,
      their nasal twang, their stiff posture, their long graces, their Hebrew
      names, the Scriptural phrases which they introduced on every occasion,
      their contempt of human learning, their detestation of polite amusements,
      were indeed fair game for the laughers. But it is not from the laughers
      alone that the philosophy of history is to be learnt. And he who
      approaches this subject should carefully guard against the influence of
      that potent ridicule which has already misled so many excellent writers.

      Those who roused the people to resistance, who directed their measures
      through a long series of eventful years, who formed, out of the most
      unpromising materials, the finest army that Europe had ever seen, who
      trampled down King, Church, and Aristocracy, who, in the short intervals
      of domestic sedition and rebellion, made the name of England terrible to
      every nation on the face of the earth, were no vulgar fanatics. Most of
      their absurdities were mere external badges, like the signs of
      freemasonry, or the dresses of friars. We regret that these badges were
      not more attractive. We regret that a body to whose courage and talents
      mankind has owed inestimable obligations had not the lofty elegance which
      distinguished some of the adherents of Charles the First, or the easy
      good-breeding for which the court of Charles the Second was celebrated.
      But, if we must make our choice, we shall, like Bassanio in the play, turn
      from the specious caskets which contain only the Death&rsquo;s head and the
      Fool&rsquo;s head, and fix on the plain leaden chest which conceals the
      treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Puritans were men whose minds had derived a peculiar character from
      the daily contemplation of superior beings and eternal interests. Not
      content with acknowledging, in general terms, an overruling Providence,
      they habitually ascribed every event to the will of the Great Being, for
      whose power nothing was too vast, for whose inspection nothing was too
      minute. To know him, to serve him, to enjoy him, was with them the great
      end of existence. They rejected with contempt the ceremonious homage which
      other sects substituted <span class="pagenum">255</span><a
      name="link255" id="link255"></a>for the pure worship of the soul. Instead
      of catching occasional glimpses of the Deity through an obscuring veil,
      they aspired to gaze full on his intolerable brightness, and to commune
      with him face to face. Hence originated their contempt for terrestrial
      distinctions. The difference between the greatest and the meanest of
      mankind seemed to vanish, when compared with the boundless interval which
      separated the whole race from him on whom their own eyes were constantly
      fixed. They recognised no title to superiority but his favour; and,
      confident of that favour, they despised all the accomplishments and all
      the dignities of the world. If they were unacquainted with the works of
      philosophers and poets, they were deeply read in the oracles of God. If
      their names were not found in the registers of heralds, they were recorded
      in the Book of Life. If their steps were not accompanied by a splendid
      train of menials, legions of ministering angels had charge over them.
      Their palaces were houses not made with hands; their diadems crowns of
      glory which should never fade away. On the rich and the eloquent, on
      nobles and priests they looked down with contempt: for they esteemed
      themselves rich in a more precious treasure, and eloquent in a more
      sublime language, nobles by the right of an earlier creation, and priests
      by the imposition of a mightier hand. The very meanest of them was a being
      to whose fate a mysterious and terrible importance belonged, on whose
      slightest action the spirits of light and darkness looked with anxious
      interest, who had been destined, before heaven and earth were created, to
      enjoy a felicity which should continue when heaven and earth should have
      passed away. Events which short-sighted politicians ascribed to earthly
      causes, had been ordained on his <span class="pagenum">256</span><a
      name="link256" id="link256"></a>account. For his sake empires had risen,
      and flourished, and decayed. For his sake the Almighty had proclaimed his
      will by the pen of the Evangelist, and the harp of the prophet. He had
      been wrested by no common deliverer from the grasp of no common foe. He
      had been ransomed by the sweat of no vulgar agony, by the blood of no
      earthly sacrifice. It was for him that the sun had been darkened, that the
      rocks had been rent, that the dead had risen, that all nature had
      shuddered at the sufferings of her expiring God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Puritan was made up of two different men, the one all
      self-abasement, penitence, gratitude, passion, the other proud, calm,
      inflexible, sagacious. He prostrated himself in the dust before his Maker:
      but he set his foot on the neck of his king. In his devotional retirement,
      he prayed with convulsions, and groans, and tears. He was half-maddened by
      glorious or terrible illusions. He heard the lyres of angels or the
      tempting whispers of fiends. He caught a gleam of the Beatific Vision, or
      woke screaming from dreams of everlasting fire. Like Vane, he thought
      himself intrusted with the sceptre of the millennial year. Like Fleetwood,
      he cried in the bitterness of his soul that God had hid his face from him.
      But when he took his seat in the council, or girt on his sword for war,
      these impestuous workings of the soul had left no perceptible trace behind
      them. People who saw nothing of the godly but their uncouth visages, and
      heard nothing from them but their groans and their whining hymns, yet
      laugh at them. But those had little reason to laugh who encountered them
      in the hall of debate or in the field of battle. These fanatics brought to
      civil and military affairs a coolness of judgment and an immutability of
      purpose which some writers have thought <span class="pagenum">257</span><a
      name="link257" id="link257"></a>inconsistent with their religious zeal,
      but which were in fact the necessary effects of it. The intensity of their
      feelings on one subject made them tranquil on every other. One
      overpowering sentiment had subjected to itself pity and hatred, ambition
      and fear. Death had lost its terrors and pleasure its charms. They had
      their smiles and their tears, their raptures and their sorrows, but not
      for the things of this world. Enthusiasm had made them Stoics, had cleared
      their minds from every vulgar passion and prejudice, and raised them above
      the influence of danger and of corruption. It sometimes might lead them to
      pursue unwise ends, but never to choose unwise means. They went through
      the world, like Sir Artegal&rsquo;s iron man Talus with his flail, crushing and
      trampling down oppressors, mingling with human beings, but having neither
      part nor lot in human infirmities, insensible to fatigue, to pleasure, and
      to pain, not to be pierced by any weapon, not to be withstood by any
      barrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such we believe to have been the character of the Puritans. We perceive
      the absurdity of their manners. We dislike the sullen gloom of their
      domestic habits. We acknowledge that the tone of their minds was often
      injured by straining after things too high for mortal reach: and we know
      that, in spite of their hatred of Popery, they too often fell into the
      worst vices of that bad system, intolerance and extravagant austerity,
      that they had their anchorites and their crusades, their Dunstans and
      their De Monforts, their Dominies and their Escobars. Yet, when all
      circumstances are taken into consideration, we do not hesitate to
      pronounce them a brave, a wise, an honest, and an useful body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Puritans espoused the cause of civil liberty <span class="pagenum">258</span><a
      name="link258" id="link258"></a>mainly because it was the cause of
      religion. There was another party, by no means numerous, but distinguished
      by learning and ability, which acted with them on very different
      principles. We speak of those whom Cromwell was accustomed to call the
      Heathens, men who were, in the phraseology of that time, doubting;
      Thomases or careless Gallios with regard to religious subjects, but
      passionate worshippers of freedom. Heated by the study of ancient
      literature, they set up their country as their idol, and proposed to
      themselves the heroes of Plutarch as their examples. They seem to have
      borne some resemblance to the Brissotines of the French Revolution. But it
      is not very easy to draw the line of distinction between them and their
      devout associates, whose tone and manner they sometimes found it
      convenient to affect, and sometimes, it is probable, imperceptibly
      adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now come to the Royalists. We shall attempt to speak of them, as we
      have spoken of their antagonists, with perfect candour. We shall not
      charge upon a whole party the profligacy and baseness of the horseboys,
      gamblers and bravoes, whom the hope of license and plunder attracted from
      all the dens of Whitefriars to the standard of Charles, and who disgraced
      their associates by excesses which, under the stricter discipline of the
      Parliamentary armies, were never tolerated. We will select a more
      favourable specimen. Thinking as we do that the cause of the King was the
      cause of bigotry and tyranny, we yet cannot refrain from looking with
      complacency on the character of the honest old Cavaliers. We feel a
      national pride in comparing them with the instruments which the despots of
      other countries are compelled to employ, with the mutes who throng their
      antechambers, and the Janissaries who <span class="pagenum">259</span><a
      name="link259" id="link259"></a>mount guard at their gates. Our royalist
      countrymen were not heartless, dangling courtiers, bowing at every step,
      and simpering at every word. They were not mere machines for destruction,
      dressed up in uniforms, caned into skill, intoxicated into valour,
      defending without love, destroying without hatred. There was a freedom in
      them subserviency, a nobleness in their very degradation. The sentiment of
      individual independence was strong within them. They were indeed misled,
      but by no base or selfish motive. Compassion and romantic honour, the
      prejudices of childhood, and the venerable names of history, threw over
      them a spell potent as that of Duessa; and, like the Red-Cross Knight,
      they thought that they were doing battle for an injured beauty, while they
      defended a false and loathsome sorceress. In truth they scarcely entered
      at all into the merits of the political question. It was not for a
      treacherous king or an intolerant church that they fought, but for the old
      banner which had waved in so many battles over the heads of their fathers,
      and for the altars at which they had received the hands of their brides.
      Though nothing could be more erroneous than their political opinions, they
      possessed, in a far greater degree than their adversaries, those qualities
      which are the grace of private life. With many of the vices of the Round
      Table, they had also many of its virtues, courtesy, generosity, veracity,
      tenderness, and respect for women. They had far more both of profound and
      of polite learning than the Puritans. Their manners were more engaging,
      their tempers more amiable, their tastes more elegant, and their
      households more cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milton did not strictly belong to any of the classes which we have
      described. He was not a Puritan. He <span class="pagenum">260</span><a
      name="link260" id="link260"></a>was not a freethinker. He was not a
      Royalist. In his character the noblest qualities of every party were
      combinée! in harmonious union. From the Parliament and from the Court,
      from the conventicle and from the Gothic cloister, from the gloomy and
      sepulchral circles of the Roundheads, and from the Christmas revel of the
      hospitable Cavalier, his nature selected and drew to itself whatever was
      great and good, while it rejected all the base and pernicious ingredients
      by which those finer elements were defiled. Like the Puritans, he lived
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent20">&ldquo;As ever in his great task-master&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo;
       </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Like them, he kept his mind continually fixed on an Almighty Judge and an
      eternal reward. And hence he acquired their contempt of external
      circumstances, their fortitude, their tranquillity, their inflexible
      resolution. But not the coolest sceptic or the most profane scoffer was
      more perfectly free from the contagion of their frantic delusions, their
      savage manners, their ludicrous jargon, their scorn of science, and their
      aversion to pleasure. Hating tyranny with a perfect hatred, he had
      nevertheless all the estimable and ornamental qualities which were almost
      entirely monopolised by the party of the tyrant. There was none who had a
      stronger sense of the value of literature, a finer relish for every
      elegant amusement, or a more chivalrous delicacy of honour and love.
      Though his opinions were democratic, his tastes and his associations were
      such as harmonise best with monarchy and aristocracy. He was under the
      influence of all the feelings by which the gallant Cavaliers were misled.
      But of those feelings he was the master and not the slave. Like the hero
      of Homer, he enjoyed all the pleasures of fascination; but he was not
      fascinated. <span class="pagenum">261</span><a name="link261"
       id="link261"></a>He listened to the song of the Syrens; yet he glided by
      without being seduced to their fatal shore. He tasted the cup of Circe;
      but he bore about him a sure antidote against the effects of its
      bewitching sweetness. The allusions which captivated his imagination never
      impaired his reasoning powers. The statesman was proof against the
      splendour, the solemnity, and the romance which enchanted the poet. Any
      person who will contrast the sentiments expressed in his treatises on
      Prelacy with the exquisite lines on ecclesiastical architecture and music
      in the Penseroso, which was published about the same time, will understand
      our meaning. This is an inconsistency which, more than any thing else,
      raises his character in our estimation, because it shows how many private
      tastes and feelings he sacrificed, in order to do what he considered his
      duty to mankind. It is the very struggle of the noble Othello. His heart
      relents; but his hand is firm. He does nought in hate, but all in honour.
      He kisses the beautiful deceiver before he destroys her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That from which the public character of Milton derives its great and
      peculiar splendour, still remains to be mentioned. If he exerted himself
      to overthrow a forsworn king and a persecuting hierarchy, he exerted
      himself in conjunction with others. But the glory of the battle which he
      fought for the species of freedom which is the most valuable, and which
      was then the least understood, the freedom of the human mind, is all his
      own. Thousands and tens of thousands among his contemporaries raised their
      voices against Ship-money and the Star-chamber. But there were few indeed
      who discerned the more fearful evils of moral and intellectual slavery,
      and the benefits which would result from the liberty of the press and the
      unfettered <span class="pagenum">262</span><a name="link262"
       id="link262"></a>exercise of private judgment. These were the objects
      which Milton justly conceived to be the most important. He was desirous
      that the people should think for themselves as well as tax themselves, and
      should be emancipated from the dominion of prejudice as well as from that
      of Charles. He knew that those who, with the best intentions, overlooked
      these schemes of reform, and contented themselves with pulling down the
      King and imprisoning the malignants, acted like the heedless brothers in
      his own poem, who, in their eagerness to disperse the train of the
      sorcerer, neglected the means of liberating the captive. They thought only
      of conquering when they should have thought of disenchanting.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      To reverse the rod, to spell the charm backward, to break the ties which
      bound a stupefied people to the seat of enchantment, was the noble aim of
      Milton. To this all his public conduct was directed. For this he joined
      the Presbyterians; for this he forsook them. He fought their perilous
      battle; but he turned away with disdain from their insolent triumph. He
      saw that they, like those whom they had vanquished, were hostile to the
      liberty of thought. He therefore joined the Independents, and called upon
      Cromwell to break the secular chain, and to save free conscience from the
      paw of the Presbyterian wolf. With a view to the same great object, he
      attacked the licensing system, in that sublime treatise which every
      statesman should wear as a sign upon his hand and as frontlets between his
      eyes. His attacks were, in general, directed less <span class="pagenum">263</span><a
      name="link263" id="link263"></a>against particular abuses than against
      those deeply-seated errors on which almost all abuses are founded, the
      servile worship of eminent men and the irrational dread of innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he might shake the foundations of these debasing sentiments more
      effectually, he always selected for himself the boldest literary services.
      He never came up in the rear, when the outworks had been carried and the
      breach entered. He pressed into the forlorn hope. At the beginning of the
      changes, he wrote with incomparable energy and eloquence against the
      bishops. But, when his opinion seemed likely to prevail, he passed on to
      other subjects, and abandoned prelacy to the crowd of writers who now
      hastened to insult a falling party. There is no more hazardous enterprise
      than that of bearing the torch of truth into those dark and infected
      recesses in which no light has ever shone. But it was the choice and the
      pleasure of Milton to penetrate the noisome vapours, and to brave the
      terrible explosion. Those who most disapprove of his opinions must respect
      the hardihood with which he maintained them. He, in general, left to
      others the credit of expounding and defending the popular parts of his
      religious and political creed. He took his own stand upon those which the
      great body of his countrymen reprobated as criminal, or derided as
      paradoxical. He stood up for divorce and regicide. He attacked the
      prevailing systems of education. His radiant and beneficent career
      resembled that of the god of light and fertility.

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be regretted that the prose writings of Milton should, in our
      time, be so little read. As compositions, <span class="pagenum">264</span><a
      name="link264" id="link264"></a>they deserve the attention of every man
      who wishes to become acquainted with the full power of the English
      language. They abound with passages compared with which the finest
      declamations of Burke sink into insignificance. They are a perfect field
      of cloth of gold. The style is stiff with gorgeous embroidery. Not even in
      the earlier hooks of the Paradise Lost has the great poet ever risen
      higher than in those parts of his controversial works in which his
      feelings, excited by conflict, find a vent in bursts of devotional and
      lyric rapture. It is, to borrow his own majestic language, &ldquo;a sevenfold
      chorus of hallelujahs and harping symphonies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had intended to look more closely at these performances, to analyse the
      peculiarities of the diction, to dwell at some length on the sublime
      wisdom of the Areopagitica and the nervous rhetoric of the Iconoclast, and
      to point out some of those magnificent passages which occur in the
      Treatise of Reformation, and the Animadversions on the Remonstrant. But
      the length to which our remarks have already extended renders this
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must conclude. And yet we can scarcely tear ourselves away from the
      subject. The days immediately following the publication of this relic of
      Milton appear to be peculiarly set apart, and consecrated to his memory.
      And we shall scarcely be censured if, on this his festival, we be found
      lingering near his shrine, how worthless soever may be the offering which
      we bring to it. While this book lies on our table, we seem to be
      contemporaries of the writer. We are transported a hundred and fifty years
      back. We can almost fancy that we are visiting him in his small lodging;
      that we see him sitting at the old organ beneath <span class="pagenum">265</span><a
      name="link265" id="link265"></a>the faded green hangings; that we can
      catch the quick twinkle of his eyes, rolling in vain to find the day; that
      we are reading in the lines of his noble countenance the proud and
      mournful history of his glory and his affliction. We image to ourselves
      the breathless silence in which we should listen to his slightest word,
      the passionate veneration with which we should kneel to kiss his hand and
      weep upon it, the earnestness with which we should endeavour to console
      him, if indeed such a spirit could need consolation, for the neglect of an
      age unworthy of his talents and his virtues, the eagerness with which we
      should contest with his daughters, or with his Quaker friend Elwood, the
      privilege of reading Homer to him, or of taking down the immortal accents
      which flowed from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are perhaps foolish feelings. Yet we cannot be ashamed of them; nor
      shall we be sorry if what we have written shall in any degree excite them
      in other minds. We are not much in the habit of idolizing either the
      living or the dead. And we think that there is no more certain indication
      of a weak and ill-regulated intellect than that propensity which, for want
      of a better name, we will venture to christen Boswellism. But there are a
      few characters which have stood the closest scrutiny and the severest
      tests, which have been tried in the furnace and have proved pure, which
      have been weighed in the balance and have not been found wanting, which
      have been declared sterling by the general consent of mankind, and which
      are visibly stamped with the image and superscription of the Most High.
      These great men we trust that we know how to prize; and of these was
      Milton. The sight of his books, the sound of his name, are pleasant to us.
      His thoughts resemble <span class="pagenum">266</span><a
      name="link266" id="link266"></a>those celestial fruits and flowers which
      the Virgin Martyr of Massinger sent down from the gardens of Paradise to
      the earth, and which were distinguished from the productions of other
      soils, not only by superior bloom and sweetness, but by miraculous
      efficacy to invigorate and to heal. They are powerful, not only to
      delight, but to elevate and purify. Nor do we envy the man who can study
      either the life or the writings of the great poet and patriot, without
      aspiring to emulate, not indeed the sublime works with which his genius
      has enriched our literature, but the zeal with which he laboured for the
      public good, the fortitude with which he endured every private calamity,
      the lofty disdain with which he looked down on temptations and dangers,
      the deadly hatred which he bore to bigots and tyrants, and the faith which
      he so sternly kept with his country and with his fame.

      legal fictions similar to those of Westminster Hall, we are frequently

      original jurisdiction. We need hardly say, therefore, that in the present

      We doubt whether any name in literary history be so generally odious as
      that of the man whose character and writings we now propose to consider.
      The terms in which he is commonly described would seem to import that he
      was the Tempter, the Evil Principle, the discoverer of ambition and
      revenge, the original inventor of perjury, and that, before the
      publication of his fatal Prince, there had never been a hypocrite, a
      tyrant, or a traitor, a simulated virtue, or a convenient crime. One
      writer gravely assures us that Maurice of Saxony learned all his

      into Turkish, the Sultans have been more addicted than formerly to the
      custom of strangling their brothers. Lord Lyttelton charges the poor
      Florentine with the manifold treasons of the house of Guise, and with the
      massacre of St. Bartholomew. Several authors have hinted that the
      Gunpowder Plot is to be primarily attributed to his doctrines, and seem to
      think that his effigy ought to be substituted for that of Guy Faux, in
      those processions by which the ingenious youth of England annually
      commemorate the preservation of the Three Estates. The Church of Rome has
      pronounced his works accursed things. Nor have our own countrymen been
      backward in testifying their opinion of his merits. Out of his surname
      they have coined an epithet for a knave, and out of his Christian name a
      synonyme for the Devil. (1)

      It is indeed scarcely possible for any person, not well acquainted with
      the history and literature of Italy, to read without horror and amazement
      the celebrated treatise winch has brought so much obloquy on the name of
      Machiavelli. Such a display of wickedness, naked yet not ashamed, such
      cool, judicious, scientific atrocity, seemed rather to belong to a fiend
      than to the most depraved of men. Principles which the most hardened
      ruffian would scarcely hint to his most trusted accomplice, or avow,
      without the disguise of some palliating sophism, even to his own mind, are
      professed without the slightest circumlocution, and assumed as the
      fundamental axioms of all political science.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But, we believe, there is a schism on this subject among the antiquarians.
      <span class="pagenum">269</span><a name="link269" id="link269"></a>the
      author of such a book as the most depraved and shameless of human beings.
      Wise men, however, have always been inclined to look with great suspicion
      on the angels and dæmons of the multitude: and in the present instance,
      several circumstances have led even superficial observers to question the
      justice of the vulgar decision. It is notorious that Machiavelli was,
      through life, a zealous republican. In the same year in which he composed
      his manual of King-craft, he suffered imprisonment and torture in the
      cause of public liberty. It seems inconceivable that the martyr of freedom
      should have designedly acted as the apostle of tyranny. Several eminent
      writers have, therefore, endeavoured to detect in this unfortunate
      performance some concealed meaning, more consistent with the character and
      conduct of the author than that which appears at the first glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hypothesis is that Machiavelli intended to practise on the young
      Lorenzo de Medici a fraud similar to that which Sunderland is said to have
      employed against our James the Second, and that he urged his pupil to
      violent and perfidious measures, as the surest means of accelerating the
      moment of deliverance and revenge. Another supposition which Lord Bacon
      seems to countenance, is that the treatise was merely a piece of grave
      irony, intended to warn nations against the arts of ambitious men. It
      would be easy to show that neither of these solutions is consistent with
      many passages in The Prince itself. But the most decisive refutation is
      that which is furnished by the other works of Machiavelli. In all the
      writings which he gave to the public, and in all those which the research
      of editors has, in the course of three centuries, discovered, in his
      Comedies, designed for the entertainment of the <span class="pagenum">270</span><a
      name="link270" id="link270"></a>multitude, in his Comments on Livy,
      intended for the perusal of the most enthusiastic patriots of Florence, in
      his History, inscribed to one of the most amiable and estimable of the
      Popes, in his public dispatches, in his private memoranda, the same
      obliquity of moral principle for which The Prince is so severely censured
      is more or less discernible. We doubt whether it would be possible to
      find, in all the many volumes of his compositions, a single expression
      indicating that dissimulation and treachery had ever struck him as
      discreditable.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, it may seem ridiculous to say that we are acquainted with few
      writings which exhibit so much elevation of sentiment, so pure and warm a
      zeal for the public good, or so just a view of the duties and rights of
      citizens, as those of Machiavelli. Yet so it is. And even from The Prince
      itself we could select many passages in support of this remark. To a
      reader of our age and country this inconsistency is, at first, perfectly
      bewildering. The whole man seems to be an enigma, a grotesque assemblage
      of incongruous qualities, selfishness and generosity, cruelty and
      benevolence, craft and simplicity, abject villany and romantic heroism.
      One sentence is such as a veteran diplomatist would scarcely write in
      cipher for the direction of his most confidential spy; the next seems to
      be extracted from a theme composed by an ardent schoolboy on the death of
      Leonidas. An act of dexterous perfidy, and an act of patriotic
      self-devotion, call forth the same kind and the same degree of respectful
      admiration. The moral sensibility of the writer seems at once to be
      morbidly obtuse and morbidly acute. Two characters altogether dissimilar
      are united in him. They are not merely joined, but interwoven. They <span
      class="pagenum">271</span><a name="link271" id="link271"></a>are the
      warp and the woof of his mind; and their combination, like that of the
      variegated threads in shot silk, gives to the whole texture a glancing and
      ever-changing appearance. The explanation might have been easy, if he had
      been a very weak or a very affected man. But he was evidently neither the
      one nor the other. His works prove, beyond all contradiction, that his
      understanding was strong, his taste pure, and his sense of the ridiculous
      exquisitely keen.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is strange: and yet the strangest is behind. There is no reason
      whatever to think, that those amongst whom he lived saw any thing shocking
      or incongruous in his writings. Abundant proofs remain of the high
      estimation in which both his works and his person were held by the most
      respectable among his contemporaries. Clement the Seventh patronised the
      publication of those very books which the Council of Trent, in the
      following generation, pronounced unfit for the perusal of Christians. Some
      members of the democratical party censured the Secretary for dedicating
      The Prince to a patron who bore the unpopular name of Medici. But to those
      immoral doctrines which have since called forth such severe reprehensions
      no exception appears to have been taken. The cry against them was first
      raised beyond the Alps, and seems to have been heard with amazement in
      Italy. The earliest assailant, as far as we are aware, was a countryman of
      our own, Cardinal Pole. The author of the Anti-Machiavelli was a French
      Protestant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, therefore, in the state of moral feeling among the Italians of
      those times that we must seek for the real explanation of what seems most
      mysterious in the life and writings of this remarkable man. As this is a
      subject which suggests many interesting considerations, <span
      class="pagenum">272</span><a name="link272" id="link272"></a>both
      political and metaphysical, we shall make no apology for discussing it at
      some length.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the gloomy and disastrous centuries which followed the downfall of
      the Roman Empire, Italy had preserved, in a far greater degree than any
      other part of Western Europe, the traces of ancient civilisation. The
      night which descended upon her was the night of an Arctic summer. The dawn
      began to reappear before the last reflection of the preceding sunset had
      faded from the horizon. It was in the time of the French Merovingians and
      of the Saxon Heptarchy that ignorance and ferocity seemed to have done
      their worst. Yet even then the Neapolitan provinces, recognising the
      authority of the Eastern Empire, preserved something of Eastern knowledge
      and refinement. Rome, protected by the sacred character of her Pontiffs,
      enjoyed at least comparative security and repose. Even in those regions
      where the sanguinary Lombards had fixed their monarchy, there was
      incomparably more of wealth, of information, of physical comfort, and of
      social order, than could be found in Gaul, Britain, or Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      That which most distinguished Italy from the neighbouring countries was
      the importance which the population of the towns, at a very early period,
      began to acquire. Some cities had been founded in wild and remote
      situations, by fugitives who had escaped from the rage of the barbarians.
      Such were Venice and Genoa, which preserved their freedom by their
      obscurity, till they became able to preserve it by their power. Other
      cities seem to have retained, under all the changing dynasties of
      invaders, under Odoacer and Theodoric, Narses and Alboin, the municipal
      institutions which had been conferred on them by the liberal policy of the
      <span class="pagenum">273</span><a name="link273" id="link273"></a>Great
      Republic. In provinces which the central government was too feeble either
      to protect or to oppress, these institutions gradually acquired stability
      and vigour. The citizens, defended by their walls, and governed by their
      own magistrates and their own by-laws, enjoyed a considerable share of
      republican independence. Thus a strong democratic spirit was called into
      action. The Carlovingian sovereigns were too imbecile to subdue it. The
      generous policy of Otlio encouraged it. It might perhaps have been
      suppressed by a close coalition between the Church and the Empire. It was
      fostered and invigorated by their disputes. In the twelfth century it
      attained its full vigour, and, after a long and doubtful conflict,
      triumphed over the abilities and courage of the Swabian Princes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assistance of the Ecclesiastical power had greatly contributed to the
      success of the Guelfs. That success would, however, have been a doubtful
      good, if its only effect had been to substitute a moral for a political
      servitude, and to exalt the Popes at the expense of the Cæsars. Happily
      the public mind of Italy had long contained the seeds of free opinions,
      which were now rapidly developed by the genial influence of free
      institutions. The people of that country had observed the whole machinery
      of the church, its saints and its miracles, its lofty pretensions and its
      splendid ceremonial, its worthless blessings and its harmless curses, too
      long and too closely to be duped. They stood behind the scenes on which
      others were gazing with childish awe and interest. They witnessed the
      arrangement of the pullies, and the manufacture of the thunders. They saw
      the natural faces and heard the natural voices of the actors. Distant
      nations looked on the Pope as the vicegerent of the Almighty, the oracle
      of <span class="pagenum">274</span><a name="link274" id="link274"></a>the
      All-wise, the umpire from whose decisions, in the disputes either of
      theologians or of kings, no Christian ought to appeal. The Italians were
      acquainted with all the follies of his youth, and with all the dishonest
      arts by which he had attained power. They knew how often he had employed
      the keys of the Church to release himself from the most sacred
      engagements, and its wealth to pamper his mistresses and nephews. The
      doctrines and rites of the established religion they treated with decent
      reverence. But though they still called themselves Catholics, they had
      ceased to be Papists. Those spiritual arms which carried terror into the
      palaces and camps of the proudest sovereigns excited only contempt in the
      immediate neighbourhood of the Vatican. Alexander, when he commanded our
      Henry the Second to submit to the lash before the tomb of a rebellious
      subject, was himself an exile. The Romans, apprehending that he
      entertained designs against their liberties, had driven him from their
      city; and, though he solemnly promised to confine himself for the future
      to his spiritual functions, they still refused to readmit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every other part of Europe, a large and powerful privileged class
      trampled on the people and defied the government. But, in the most
      flourishing parts of Italy, the feudal nobles were reduced to comparative
      insignificance. In some districts they took shelter under the protection
      of the powerful commonwealths which they were unable to oppose, and
      gradually sank into the mass of burghers. In other places they possessed
      great influence; but it was an influence widely different from that which
      was exercised by the aristocracy of any Transalpine kingdom. They were not
      petty princes, but eminent citizens. Instead of strengthening <span
      class="pagenum">275</span><a name="link275" id="link275"></a>their
      fastnesses among the mountains, they embellished their palaces in the
      market-place. The state of society in the Neapolitan dominions, and in
      some parts of the Ecclesiastical State, more nearly resembled that which
      existed in the great monarchies of Europe. But the governments of Lombardy
      and Tuscany, through all their revolutions, preserved a different
      character. A people, when assembled in a town, is far more formidable to
      its rulers than when dispersed over a wide extent of country. The most
      arbitrary of the Cæsars found it necessary to feed and divert the
      inhabitants of their unwieldly capital at the expense of the provinces.
      The citizens of Madrid have more than once besieged their sovereign in his
      own palace, and extorted from him the most humiliating concessions. The
      Sultans have often been compelled to propitiate the furious rabble of
      Constantinople with the head of an unpopular Vizier. From the same cause
      there was a certain tinge of democracy in the monarchies and aristocracies
      of Northern Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus liberty, partially indeed and transiently, revisited Italy; and with
      liberty came commerce and empire, science and taste, all the comforts and
      all the ornaments of life. The Crusades, from which the inhabitants of
      other countries gained nothing but relics and wounds, brought to the
      rising commonwealths of the Adriatic and Tyrrhene seas a large increase of
      wealth, dominion, and knowledge. The moral and the geographical position
      of those commonwealths enabled them to profit alike by the barbarism of
      the West and by the civilisation of the East. Italian ships covered every
      sea. Italian factories rose on every shore. The tables of Italian
      money-changers were set in every city. Manufactures flourished. Banks were
      established. <span class="pagenum">276</span><a name="link276"
       id="link276"></a>The operations of the commercial machine were facilitated
      by many useful and beautiful inventions. We doubt whether any country of
      Europe, our own excepted, have at the present time reached so high a point
      of wealth and civilisation as some parts of Italy had attained four
      hundred years ago. Historians rarely descend to those details from which
      alone the real state of a community can be collected. Hence posterity is
      too often deceived by the vague hyperboles of poets and rhetoricians, who
      mistake the splendour of a court for the happiness of a people.
      Fortunately, John Villani has given us an ample and precise account of the
      state of Florence in the early part of the fourteenth century. The revenue
      of the Republic amounted to three hundred thousand florins; a sum which,
      allowing for the depreciation of the precious metals, was at least
      equivalent to six hundred thousand pounds sterling; a larger sum than
      England and Ireland, two centuries ago, yielded annually to Elizabeth. The
      manufacture of wool alone employed two hundred factories and thirty
      thousand workmen. The cloth annually produced sold, at an average, for
      twelve hundred thousand florins; a sum fully equal, in exchangeable value,
      to two millions and a half of our money. Four hundred thousand florins
      were annually coined. Eighty banks conducted the commercial operations,
      not of Florence only, but of all Europe. The transactions of these
      establishments were sometimes of a magnitude which may surprise even the
      contemporaries of the Barings and the Rothschilds. Two houses advanced to
      Edward the Third of England upwards of three hundred thousand marks, at a
      time when the mark contained more silver than fifty shillings of the
      present day, and when the value of silver was more <span class="pagenum">277</span><a
      name="link277" id="link277"></a>than quadruple of what it now is. The city
      and its environs contained a hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants. In
      the various schools about ten thousand children were taught to read:
      twelve hundred studied arithmetic; six hundred received a learned
      education.
    </p>
    <p>
      The progress of elegant literature and of the fine arts was proportioned
      to that of the public prosperity. Under the despotic successors of
      Augustus, all the fields of the intellect had been turned into arid
      wastes, still marked out by formal boundaries, still retaining the traces
      of old cultivation, but yielding neither flowers nor fruit. The deluge of
      barbarism came. It swept away all the landmarks. It obliterated all the
      signs of former tillage. But it fertilised while it devastated. When it
      receded, the wilderness was as the garden of God, rejoicing on every side,
      laughing, clapping its hands, pouring forth, in spontaneous abundance,
      every thing brilliant, or fragrant, or nourishing. A new language,
      characterised by simple sweetness and simple energy, had attained
      perfection. No tongue ever furnished more gorgeous and vivid tints to
      poetry; nor was it long before a poet appeared, who knew how to employ
      them. Early in the fourteenth century came forth the Divine Comedy, beyond
      comparison the greatest work of imagination which had appeared since the
      poems of Homer. The following generation produced indeed no second Dante:
      but it was eminently distinguished by general intellectual activity. The
      study of the Latin writers had never been wholly neglected in Italy. But
      Petrarch introduced a more profound, liberal, and elegant scholarship, had
      communicated to his countrymen that enthusiasm for the literature, the
      history, and the antiquities of Rome, which divided his own heart with a
      frigid mistress and a more frigid <span class="pagenum">278</span><a
      name="link278" id="link278"></a>Muse. Boccaccio turned their attention to
      the more sublime and graceful models of Greece.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time, the admiration of learning and genius became almost an
      idolatry among the people of Italy. Kings and republics, cardinals and
      doges, vied with each other in honouring and flattering Petrarch.
      Embassies from rival states solicited the honour of his instructions. His
      coronation agitated the Court of Naples and the people of Rome as much as
      the most important political transaction could have done. To collect books
      and antiques, to found professorships, to patronise men of learning,
      became almost universal fashions among the great. The spirit of literary
      research allied itself to that of commercial enterprise. Every place to
      which the merchant princes of Florence extended their gigantic traffic,
      from the bazars of the Tigris to the monasteries of the Clyde, was
      ransacked for medals and manuscripts. Architecture, painting, and
      sculpture, were munificently encouraged. Indeed it would be difficult to
      name an Italian of eminence, during the period of which we speak, who,
      whatever may have been his general character, did not at least affect a
      love of letters and of the arts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowledge and public prosperity continued to advance together. Both
      attained their meridian in the age of Lorenzo the Magnificent. We cannot
      refrain from quoting the splendid passage, in which the Tuscan Thucydides
      describes the state of Italy at that period. &ldquo;Ridotta tutta in somma pace
      e tranquillità, coltivata non meno ne&rsquo; luoghi più montuosi e pin sterili
      che nelle pianure e regîoni più fertili, ne sottoposta ad altro imperio
      che de&rsquo; suoi medesimi, non solo era abbon-dantissima d&rsquo; abitatori c di
      ricchezze; ma illustrata, sommamente dalla magnificenza di molti principi,
      dallo <span class="pagenum">279</span><a name="link279" id="link279"></a>splendore
      cli moite nobilissime e bellissime città, dalla sedia e maestà della
      religione, fioriva d&rsquo; nomini prestantissimi ela amministrazione delle cose
      publiche, e d&rsquo; ingegni molto nobili in tutte le scienze, ed in qua-lunque
      arte preelara ed industriosa.&rdquo; When we peruse this just and splendid
      description, we can scarcely persuade ourselves that we are reading of
      times in which the annals of England and France present us only with a
      frightful spectacle of poverty, barbarity, and ignorance. From the
      oppressions of illiterate masters, and the sufferings of a degraded
      peasantry, it is delightful to turn to the opulent and enlightened States
      of Italy, to the vast and magnificent cities, the ports, the arsenals, the
      villas, the museums, the libraries, the marts filled with every article of
      comfort or luxury, the factories swarming with artisans, the Apennines
      covered with rich cultivation up to their very summits, the Po wafting the
      harvests of Lombardy to the granaries of Venice, and carrying back the
      silks of Bengal and the furs of Siberia to the palaces of Milan. With
      peculiar pleasure, every cultivated mind must repose on the fair, the
      happy, the glorious Florence, the halls which rang with the mirth of
      Pulci, the cell where twinkled the midnight lamp of Politian, the statues
      on which the young eye of Michael Angelo glared with the frenzy of a
      kindred inspiration, the gardens in which Lorenzo meditated some sparkling
      song for the May-day dance of the Etrurian virgins. Alas for the beautiful
      city! Alas, for the wit and the learning, the genius and the love!

      A time was at hand, when all the seven vials of the <span class="pagenum">280</span><a
      name="link280" id="link280"></a>Apocalypse were to be poured forth and
      shaken out over those pleasant countries, a time of slaughter, famine,
      beggary, infamy, slavery, despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Italian States, as in many natural bodies, untimely decrepitude was
      the penalty of precocious maturity. Their early greatness, and their early
      decline, are principally to be attributed to the same cause, the
      preponderance which the towns acquired in the political system.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a community of hunters or of shepherds, every man easily and
      necessarily becomes a soldier. His ordinary avocations are perfectly
      compatible with all the duties of military service. However remote may be
      the expedition on which he is bound, he finds it easy to transport with
      him the stock from which he derives his subsistence. The whole people is
      an army; the whole year a march. Such was the state of society which
      facilitated the gigantic conquests of Attila and Tamerlane.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a people which subsists by the cultivation of the earth is in a very
      different situation. The husbandman is bound to the soil on which he
      labours. A long campaign would be ruinous to him. Still his pursuits are
      such as give to his frame both the active and the passive strength
      necessary to a soldier. Nor do they, at least in the infancy of
      agricultural science, demand his uninterrupted attention. At particular
      times of the year he is almost wholly unemployed, and can, without injury
      to himself, afford the time necessary for a short expedition. Thus the
      legions of Rome were supplied during its earlier wars. The season during
      which the fields did not require the presence of the cultivators sufficed
      for a short inroad and a battle. These operations, too frequently
      interrupted to produce <span class="pagenum">281</span><a
      name="link281" id="link281"></a>decisive results, yet served to keep up
      among the people a degree of discipline and courage which rendered them,
      not only secure, but formidable. The archers and billmen of the middle
      ages, who, with provisions for forty days at their backs, left the fields
      for the camp, were troops of the same description.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when commerce and manufactures begin to flourish a great change takes
      place. The sedentary habits of the desk and the loom render the exertions
      and hardships of war insupportable. The business of traders and artisans
      requires their constant presence and attention. In such a community there
      is little superfluous time; but there is generally much superfluous money.
      Some members of the society are, therefore, hired to relieve the rest from
      a task inconsistent with their habits and engagements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of Greece is, in this, as in many other respects, the best
      commentary on the history of Italy. Five hundred years before the
      Christian era, the citizens of the republics round the Ægean Sea formed
      perhaps the finest militia that ever existed. As wealth and refinement
      advanced, the system underwent a gradual alteration. The Ionian States
      were the first in which commerce and the arts were cultivated, and the
      first in which the ancient discipline decayed. Within eighty years after
      the battle of Platæa, mercenary troops were every where plying for battles
      and sieges. In the time of Demosthenes, it was scarcely possible to
      persuade or compel the Athenians to enlist for foreign service. The laws
      of Lycurgus prohibited trade and manufactures. The Spartans, therefore,
      continued to form a national force long after their neighbours had begun
      to hire soldiers. But their military spirit declined with their singular
      institutions. In <span class="pagenum">282</span><a name="link282"
       id="link282"></a>the second century before Christ, Greece contained only
      one nation of warriors, the savage highlanders of Ætolia, who were some
      generations behind their countrymen in civilisation and intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the causes which produced these effects among the Greeks acted still
      more strongly on the modern Italians. Instead of a power like Sparta, in
      its nature warlike, they had amongst them an ecclesiastical state, in its
      nature pacific. Where there are numerous slaves, every freeman is induced
      by the strongest motives to familiarise himself with the use of arms. The
      commonwealths of Italy did not, like those of Greece, swarm with thousands
      of these household enemies. Lastly, the mode in which military operations
      were conducted during the prosperous times of Italy was peculiarly
      unfavourable to the formation of an efficient militia. Men covered with
      iron from head to foot, armed with ponderous lances, and mounted on horses
      of the largest breed, were considered as composing the strength of an
      army. The infantry was regarded as comparatively worthless, and was
      neglected till it became really so. These tactics maintained their ground
      for centuries in most parts of Europe. That foot soldiers could withstand
      the charge of heavy cavalry was thought utterly impossible, till, towards
      the close of the fifteenth century, the rude mountaineers of Switzerland
      dissolved the spell, and astounded the most experienced generals by
      receiving the dreaded shock on an impenetrable forest of pikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of the Grecian spear, the Roman sword, or the modern bayonet,
      might be acquired with comparative ease. But nothing short of the daily
      exercise of years could train the man at arms to support his ponderous
      panoply, and manage his unwieldy weapon. Throughout <span class="pagenum">283</span><a
      name="link283" id="link283"></a>Europe this most important branch of war
      became a separate profession. Beyond the Alps, indeed, though a
      profession, it was not generally a trade. It was the duty and the
      amusement of a large class of country gentlemen. It was the service by
      which they held their lands, and the diversion by which, in the absence of
      mental resources, they beguiled their leisure. But in the Northern States
      of Italy, as we have already remarked, the growing power of the cities,
      where it had not exterminated this order of men, had completely changed
      their habits. Here, therefore, the practice of employing mercenaries
      became universal, at a time when it was almost unknown in other countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      When war becomes the trade of a separate class, the least dangerous course
      left to a government is to form that class into a standing army. It is
      scarcely possible, that men can pass their lives in the service of one
      state, without feeling some interest in its greatness. Its victories are
      their victories. Its defeats are their defeats. The contract loses
      something of its mercantile character. The services of the soldier are
      considered as the effects of patriotic zeal, his pay as the tribute of
      national gratitude. To betray the power which employs him, to be even
      remiss in its service, are in his eyes the most atrocious and degrading of
      crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the princes and commonwealths of Italy began to use hired troops,
      their wisest course would have been to form separate military
      establishments. Unhappily this was not done. The mercenary warriors of the
      Peninsula, instead of being attached to the service of different powers,
      were regarded as the common property of all. The connection between the
      state and its defenders was reduced to the most simple and naked traffic.
      The adventurer brought his horse, <span class="pagenum">284</span><a
      name="link284" id="link284"></a>his weapons, his strength, and his
      experience, into the market. Whether the King of Naples or the Duke of
      Milan, the Pope or the Signory of Florence, struck the bargain, was to him
      a matter of perfect indifference. He was for the highest wages and the
      longest term. When the campaign for which he had contracted was finished,
      there was neither law nor punctilio to prevent him from instantly turning
      his arms against his late masters. The soldier was altogether disjoined
      from the citizen and from the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natural consequences followed. Left to the conduct of men who neither
      loved those whom they defended, nor hated those whom they opposed, who
      were often bound by stronger ties to the army against which they fought
      than to the state which they served, who lost by the termination of the
      conflict, and gained by its prolongation, war completely changed its
      character. Every man came into the field of battle impressed with the
      knowledge that, in a few days, he might be taking the pay of the power
      against which he was then employed, and fighting by the side of his
      enemies against his associates. The strongest interests and the strongest
      feelings concurred to mitigate the hostility of those who had lately been
      brethren in arms, and who might soon be brethren in arms once more. Their
      common profession was a bond of union not to be forgotten even when they
      were engaged in the service of contending parties. Hence it was that
      operations, languid and indecisive beyond any recorded in history, marches
      and countermarches, pillaging expeditions and blockades, bloodless
      capitulations and equally bloodless combats, make up the military history
      of Italy during the course of nearly two centuries. Mighty armies fight
      from sunrise to sunset. A great <span class="pagenum">285</span><a
      name="link285" id="link285"></a>victory is won. Thousands of prisoners are
      taken; and hardly a life is lost. A pitched battle seems to have been
      really less dangerous than an ordinary civil tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courage was now no longer necessary even to the military character. Men
      grew old in camps, and acquired the highest renown by their warlike
      achievements, without being once required to face serious danger. The
      political consequences are too well known. The richest and most
      enlightened part of the world was left undefended to the assaults of every
      barbarous invader, to the brutality of Switzerland, the insolence of
      France, and the fierce rapacity of Arragon. The moral effects which
      followed from this state of things were still more remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the rude nations which lay beyond the Alps, valour was absolutely
      indispensable. Without it none could be eminent; few could be secure.
      Cowardice was, therefore, naturally considered as the foulest reproach.
      Among the polished Italians, enriched by commerce, governed by law, and
      passionately attached to literature, every thing was done by superiority
      of intelligence. Their very wars, more pacific than the peace of their
      neighbours, required rather civil than military qualifications. Hence,
      while courage was the point of honour in other countries, ingenuity became
      the point of honour in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these principles were deduced, by processes strictly analogous, two
      opposite systems of fashionable morality. Through the greater part of
      Europe, the vices which peculiarly belong to timid dispositions, and which
      are the natural defence of weakness, fraud, and hypocrisy, have always
      been most disreputable. On the other hand, the excesses of haughty and
      daring <span class="pagenum">286</span><a name="link286" id="link286"></a>spirits
      have been treated with indulgence, and even with respect. The Italians
      regarded with corresponding lenity those crimes which require
      self-command, address, quick observation, fertile invention, and profound
      knowledge of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a prince as our Henry the Fifth would have been the idol of the
      North. The follies of his youth, the selfish ambition of his manhood, the
      Lollards roasted at slow fires, the prisoners massacred on the field of
      battle, the expiring lease of priestcraft renewed for another century, the
      dreadful legacy of a causeless and hopeless war bequeathed to a people who
      had no interest in its event, every thing is forgotten but the victory of
      Agincourt. Francis Sforza, on the other hand, was the model of Italian
      heroes. He made his employers and his rivals alike his tools. He first
      overpowered his open enemies by the help of faithless allies; he then
      armed himself against his allies with the spoils taken from his enemies.
      By his incomparable dexterity, he raised himself from the precarious and
      dependent situation of a military adventurer to the first throne of Italy.
      To such a man much was forgiven, hollow friendship, ungenerous enmity,
      violated faith. Such are the opposite errors which men commit, when their
      morality is not a science but a taste, when they abandon eternal
      principles for accidental associations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have illustrated our meaning by an instance taken from history. We will
      select another from fiction. Othello murders his wife; he gives orders for
      the murder of his lieutenant; he ends by murdering himself. Yet he never
      loses the esteem and affection of Northern readers. His intrepid and
      ardent spirit redeems every thing. The unsuspecting confidence <span
      class="pagenum">287</span><a name="link287" id="link287"></a>with
      which he listens to his adviser, the agony with which he shrinks from the
      thought of shame, the tempest of passion with which he commits his crimes,
      and the haughty fearlessness with which he avows them, give an
      extraordinary interest to his character. Iago, on the contrary, is the
      object of universal loathing. Many are inclined to suspect that Shakspeare
      has been seduced into an exaggeration unusual with him, and has drawn a
      monster who has no archetype in human nature. Now we suspect that an
      Italian audience in the fifteenth century would have felt very
      differently. Othello would have inspired nothing but detestation and
      contempt. The folly with which he trusts the friendly professions of a man
      whose promotion he had obstructed, the credulity with which he takes
      unsupported assertions, and trivial circumstances, for unanswerable
      proofs, the violence with which he silences the exculpation till the
      exculpation can only aggravate his misery, would have excited the
      abhorrence and disgust of the spectators. The conduct of Iago they would
      assuredly have condemned; but they would have condemned it as we condemn
      that of his victim. Something of interest and respect would have mingled
      with their disapprobation. The readiness of the traitor&rsquo;s wit, the
      clearness of his judgment, the skill with which he penetrates the
      dispositions of others and conceals his own, would have insured to him a
      certain portion of their esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      So wide was the difference between the Italians and their neighbours. A
      similar difference existed between the Greeks of the second century before
      Christ, and their masters the Romans. The conquerors, brave and resolute,
      faithful to their engagements, and strongly influenced by religious
      feelings, were, at the same time. <span class="pagenum">288</span><a
      name="link288" id="link288"></a>ignorant, arbitrary, and cruel. With the
      vanquished people were deposited all the art, the science, and the
      literature of the Western world. In poetry, in philosophy, in painting, in
      architecture, in sculpture, they had no rivals. Their manners were
      polished, their perceptions acute, their invention ready; they were
      tolerant, affable, humane; but of courage and sincerity they were almost
      utterly destitute. Every rude centurion consoled himself for his
      intellectual inferiority, by remarking that knowledge and taste seemed
      only to make men atheists, cowards, and slaves. The distinction long
      continued to be strongly marked, and furnished an admirable subject for
      the fierce sarcasms of Juvenal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The citizen of an Italian commonwealth was the Greek of the time of
      Juvenal and the Greek of the time of Pericles, joined in one. Like the
      former, he was timid and pliable, artful and mean. But, like the latter,
      he had a country. Its independence and prosperity were dear to him. If his
      character were degraded by some base crimes, it was, on the other hand,
      ennobled by public spirit and by an honourable ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vice sanctioned by the general opinion is merely a vice. The evil
      terminates in itself. A vice condemned by the general opinion produces a
      pernicious effect on the whole character. The former is a local malady,
      the latter a constitutional taint. When the reputation of the offender is
      lost, he too often flings the remains of his virtue after it in despair.
      The Highland gentleman who, a century ago, lived by taking black mail from
      his neighbours, committed the same crime for which Wild was accompanied to
      Tyburn by the huzzas of two hundred thousand people. <span class="pagenum">289</span><a
      name="link289" id="link289"></a>But there can be no doubt that he was a
      much less depraved man than Wild. The deed for which Mrs. Brownrigg was
      hanged sinks into nothing, when compared with the conduct of the Roman who
      treated the public to a hundred pair of gladiators. Yet we should greatly
      wrong such a Roman if we supposed that his disposition was as cruel as
      that of Mrs. Brownrigg.

    <p>
      In our own country, a woman forfeits her place in society by what, in a
      man, is too commonly considered as an honourable distinction, and, at
      worst, as a venial error. The consequence is notorious. The moral
      principle of a woman is frequently more impaired by a single lapse from
      virtue than that of a man by twenty years of intrigues. Classical
      antiquity would furnish us with instances stronger, if possible, than
      those to which we have referred.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must apply this principle to the case before us. Habits of
      dissimulation and falsehood, no doubt, mark a man of our age and country
      as utterly worthless and abandoned. But it by no means follows that a
      similar judgment would be just in the case of an Italian in the middle
      ages. On the contrary, we frequently find those faults which we are
      accustomed to consider as certain indications of a mind altogether
      depraved, in company with great and good qualities, with generosity, with
      benevolence, with disinterestedness. From such a state of society,
      Palamedes, in the admirable dialogue of Hume, might have drawn
      illustrations of his theory as striking as any of those with which Fourli
      furnished him. These are not, we well know, the lessons which historians
      are generally most careful to teach, or readers most willing to learn. But
      they are not therefore useless. How Philip disposed his troops at
      Cheronea, where Hannibal crossed the Alps, whether Mary blew <span
      class="pagenum">290</span><a name="link290" id="link290"></a>up
      Darnley, or Siquier shot Charles the Twelfth, and ten thousand other
      questions of the same description, are in themselves unimportant. The
      inquiry may amuse us, but the decision leaves us no wiser. He alone reads
      history aright who, observing how powerfully circumstances influence the
      feelings and opinions of men, how often vices pass into virtues and
      paradoxes into axioms, learns to distinguish what is accidental and
      transitory in human nature from what is essential and immutable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this respect no history suggests more important reflections than that
      of the Tuscan and Lombard commonwealths. The character of the Italian
      statesman seems, at first sight, a collection of contradictions, a phantom
      as monstrous as the portress of hell in Milton, half divinity, half snake,
      majestic and beautiful above, grovelling and poisonous below. We see a man
      whose thoughts and words have no connection with each other, who never
      hesitates at an oath when he wishes to seduce, who never wants a pretext
      when he is inclined to betray. His cruelties spring, not from the heat of
      blood, or the insanity of uncontrolled power, but from deep and cool
      meditation. His passions, like well-trained troops, are impetuous by rule,
      and in their most headstrong fury never forget the discipline to which
      they have been accustomed. His whole soul is occupied with vast and
      complicated schemes of ambition: yet his aspect and language exhibit
      nothing but philosophical moderation. Hatred and revenge eat into his
      heart: yet every look is a cordial smile, every gesture a familiar caress.
      He never excites the suspicion of his adversaries by petty provocations.
      His purpose is disclosed only when it is accomplished. His face is
      unruffled, his speech is courteous, till vigilance is laid <span
      class="pagenum">291</span><a name="link291" id="link291"></a>asleep,
      till a vital point is exposed, till a sure aim is taken; and then he
      strikes for the first and last time. Military courage, the boast of the
      sottish German, of the frivolous and prating Frenchman, of the romantic
      and arrogant Spaniard, he neither possesses nor values. He shuns danger,
      not because he is insensible to shame, but because, in the society in
      which he lives, timidity has ceased to be shameful. To do an injury openly
      is, in his estimation, as wicked as to do it secretly, and far less
      profitable. With him the most honourable means are those which are the
      surest, the speediest, and the darkest. He cannot comprehend how a man
      should scruple to deceive those whom he does not scruple to destroy. He
      would think it madness to declare open hostilities against rivals whom he
      might stab in a friendly embrace, or poison in a consecrated wafer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this man, black with the vices which we consider as most loathsome,
      traitor, hypocrite, coward, assassin, was by no means destitute even of
      those virtues which we generally consider as indicating superior elevation
      of character. In civil courage, in perseverance, in presence of mind,
      those barbarous warriors, who were foremost in the battle or the breach,
      were far his inferiors. Even the dangers which he avoided with a caution
      almost pusillanimous never confused his perceptions, never paralysed his
      inventive faculties, never wrung out one secret from his smooth tongue,
      and his inscrutable brow. Though a dangerous enemy, and a still more
      dangerous accomplice, he could be a just and beneficent ruler. With so
      much unfairness in his policy, there was an extraordinary degree of
      fairness in his intellect. Indifferent to truth in the transactions of
      life, he was honestly devoted to truth in the researches of speculation.
      Wanton cruelty was not in his nature. <span class="pagenum">292</span><a
      name="link292" id="link292"></a>On the contrary, where no political object
      was at stake, his disposition was soft and humane. The susceptibility of
      his nerves and the activity of his imagination inclined him to sympathise
      with the feelings of others, and to delight in the charities and
      courtesies of social life. Perpetually descending to actions which might
      seem to mark a mind diseased through all its faculties, he had
      nevertheless an exquisite sensibility, both for the natural and the moral
      sublime, for every graceful and every lofty conception. Habits of petty
      intrigue and dissimulation might have rendered him incapable of great
      general views, but that the expanding effect of his philosophical studies
      counteracted the narrowing tendency. He had the keenest enjoyment of wit,
      eloquence, and poetry. The fine arts profited alike by the severity of his
      judgment, and by the liberality of his patronage. The portraits of some of
      the remarkable Italians of those times are perfectly in harmony with this
      description. Ample and majestic ^ foreheads, brows strong and dark, but
      not frowning, eyes of which the calm full gaze, while it expresses
      nothing, seems to discern every thing, cheeks pale with thought and
      sedentary habits, lips formed with feminine delicacy, but compressed with
      more than masculine decision, mark out men at once enterprising and timid,
      men equally skilled in detecting the purposes of others, and in concealing
      their own, men who must have been formidable enemies and unsafe allies,
      but men, at the same time, whose tempers were mild and equable, and who
      possessed an amplitude and subtlety of intellect which would have rendered
      them eminent either in active or in contemplative life, and fitted them
      either to govern or to instruct mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every age and every nation has certain characteristic <span class="pagenum">293</span><a
      name="link293" id="link293"></a>vices, which prevail almost universally,
      which scarcely any person scruples to avow, and which even rigid moralists
      but faintly censure. Succeeding generations change the fashion of their
      morals, with the fashion of their hats and their coaches; take some other
      kind of wickedness under their patronage, and wonder at the depravity of
      their ancestors. Nor is this all. Posterity, that high court of appeal
      which is never tired of eulogising its own justice and discernment, acts
      on such occasions like a Roman dictator after a general mutiny. Finding
      the delinquents too numerous to be all punished, it selects some of them
      at hazard, to hear the whole penalty of an offence in which they are not
      more deeply implicated than those who escape. Whether decimation be a
      convenient mode of military execution, we know not; but we solemnly
      protest against the introduction of such a principle into the philosophy
      of history.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present instance, the lot has fallen on Machavelli, a man whose
      public conduct was upright and honourable, whose views of morality, where
      they differed from those of the persons around him, seemed to have
      differed for the better, and whose only fault was, that, having adopted
      some of the maxims then generally received, he arranged them more
      luminously, and expressed them more forcibly, than any other writer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having now, we hope, in some degree cleared the personal character of
      Machiavelli, we come to the consideration of his works. As a poet he is
      not entitled to a high place; but his comedies deserve attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mandragola, in particular, is superior to the best of Goldoni, and
      inferior only to the best of Molière. It is the work of a man who, if he
      had devoted himself to the drama, would probably have attained <span
      class="pagenum">294</span><a name="link294" id="link294"></a>the
      highest eminence, and produced a permanent and salutary effect on the
      national taste. This we infer, not so much from the degree, as from the
      kind of its excellence. There are compositions which indicate still
      greater talent, and which are perused with still greater delight, from
      which we should have drawn very different conclusions. Books quite
      worthless are quite harmless. The sure sign of the general decline of an
      art is the frequent occurrence, not of deformity, but of misplaced beauty.
      In general, Tragedy is corrupted by eloquence, and Comedy by wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real object of the drama is the exhibition of human character. This,
      we conceive, is no arbitrary canon, originating in local and temporary
      associations, like those canons which regulate the number of acts in a
      play, or of syllables in a line. To this fundamental law every other
      regulation is subordinate. The situations which most signally develop
      character form the best plot. The mother tongue of the passions is the
      best style.
    </p>
    <p>
      This principle, rightly understood, does not debar the poet from any grace
      of composition. There is no style in which some man may not, under some
      circumstances, express himself. There is therefore no style which the
      drama rejects, none which it does not occasionally require. It is in the
      discernment of place, of time, and of person, that the inferior artists
      fail. The fantastic rhapsody of Mercutio, the elaborate declamation of
      Antony, are, where Shakspeare has placed them, natural and pleasing. But
      Dryden would have made Mer-cutio challenge Tybalt in hyperboles as
      fanciful as those in which he describes the chariot of Mab. Corneille
      would have represented Antony as scolding and coaxing Cleopatra with all
      the measured rhetoric of a funeral oration. <span class="pagenum">295</span><a
      name="link295" id="link295"></a>No writers have injured the Comedy of
      England so deeply as Congreve and Sheridan. Both were men of splendid wit
      and polished taste. Unhappily, they made all their characters in their own
      likeness. Their works bear the same relation to the legitimate drama,
      which a transparency bears to a painting. There are no delicate touches,
      no hues imperceptibly fading into each other: the whole is lighted up with
      an universal glare. Outlines and tints are forgotten in the common blaze
      whicli illuminates all. The flowers and fruits of the intellect abound;
      but it is the abundance of a jungle, not of a garden, unwholesome,
      bewildering, unprofitable from its very plenty, rank from its very
      fragrance. Every fop, every boor, every valet, is a man of wit. The very
      butts and dupes, Tattle, Witwould, Puff, Acres, outshine the whole Hotel
      of Rambouillet. To prove the whole system of this school erroneous, it is
      only necessary to apply the test which dissolved the enchanted Florimel,
      to place the true by the false Thalia, to contrast the most celebrated
      characters which have been drawn by the writers of whom we speak with the
      Bastard in King John, or the Nurse in Romeo and Juliet. It was not surely
      from want of wit that Shakspeare adopted so different a manner. Benedick
      and Beatrice throw Mirabel and Millamant into the shade. All the good
      sayings of the facetious houses of Absolute and Surface might have been
      clipped from the single character of Falstaff without being missed. It
      would have been easy for that fertile mind to have given Bardolph and
      Shallow as much wit as Prince Hal, and to have made Dogberry and Verges
      retort on each other in sparkling epigrams. But he knew that such
      indiscriminate prodigality was, to use his own admirable language, &ldquo;from
      the purpose of playing, whose end, <span class="pagenum">296</span><a
      name="link296" id="link296"></a>both at the first and now, was, and is, to
      hold, as it were, the mirror up to Nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This digression will enable our readers to understand what we mean when we
      say that in the Mandragola, Machiavelli has proved that he completely
      understood the nature of the dramatic art, and possessed talents which
      would have enabled him to excel in it. By the correct and vigorous
      delineation of human nature, it produces interest without a pleasing or
      skilful plot, and laughter without the least ambition of wit. The lover,
      not a very delicate or generous lover, and his adviser the parasite, are
      drawn with spirit. The hypocritical confessor is an admirable portrait. He
      is, if we mistake not, the original of Father Dominic, the best comic
      character of Dryden. But old Nicias is the glory of the piece. We cannot
      call to mind any thing that resembles him. The follies which Molière
      ridicules are those of affectation, not those of fatuity. Coxcombs and
      pedants, not absolute simpletons, are his game. Shakspeare has indeed a
      vast assortment of fools; but the precise species of which we speak is
      not, if we remember right, to be found there. Shallow is a fool. But his
      animal spirits supply, to a certain degree, the place of cleverness. His
      talk is to that of Sir John what soda water is to champagne. It has the
      effervescence though not the body or the flavour. Slender and Sir Andrew
      Aguecheek are fools, troubled with an uneasy consciousness of their folly,
      which, in the latter produces meekness and docility, and in the former,
      awkwardness, obstinacy, and confusion. Cloten is an arrogant fool, Osric a
      foppish fool, Ajax a savage fool; but Nicias is, as Thersites says of
      Patroclus, a fool positive. His mind is occupied by no strong feeling; it
      takes every character, and retains none; its aspect is <span
      class="pagenum">297</span><a name="link297" id="link297"></a>diversified,
      not by passions, but by faint and transitory semblances of passion, a mock
      joy, a mock fear, a mock love, a mock pride, which chase each other like
      shadows over its surface, and vanish as soon as they appear. He is just
      idiot enough to be an object, not of pity or horror, but of ridicule. He
      bears some resemblance to poor Calandrino, whose mishaps, as recounted by
      Boccaccio, have made all Europe merry for more than four centuries. He
      perhaps resembles still more closely Simon da Villa, to whom Bruno and
      Buffalmacco promised the love of the Countess Civilian. Nicias is, like
      Simon, of a learned profession; and the dignity with which he wears the
      doctoral fur, renders his absurdities infinitely more grotesque. The old
      Tuscan is the very language for such a being. Its peculiar simplicity
      gives even to the most forcible reasoning and the most brilliant wit an
      infantine air, generally delightful, but to a foreign reader sometimes a
      little ludicrous. Heroes and statesmen seem to lisp when they use it. It
      becomes Nicias incomparably, and renders all his silliness infinitely more
      silly.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may add, that the verses with which the Man-dragola is interspersed,
      appear to us to be the most spirited and correct of all that Machiavelli
      has written in metre. He seems to have entertained the same opinion; for
      he has introduced some of them in other places. The contemporaries of the
      author were not blind to the merits of this striking piece. It was acted
      at Florence with the greatest success. Leo the Tenth was among its
      admirers, and by his order it was represented at Rome. (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Nothing can be more evident than that Paulus Jovius
     designates the Mandragola under the name of the Nicias. We
     should not have noticed what is so perfectly obvious, were
     it not that this natural and palpable misnomer has led the
     sagacious and industrious Bayle into a gross error.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">298</span><a name="link298" id="link298"></a>The
      Clizia is an imitation of the Casina of Plautus, which is itself an
      imitation of the lost (work) of Diphilus. Plautus was, unquestionably, one
      of the best Latin writers; but the Casina is by no means one of his best
      plays; nor is it one which offers great facilities to an imitator. The
      story is as alien from modern habits of life, as the manner in which it is
      developed from the modern fashion of composition. The lover remains in the
      country and the heroine in her chamber during the whole action, leaving;
      their fate to be decided by a foolish father, a cunning mother, and two
      knavish servants. Machiavelli has executed his task with judgment and
      taste. He has accommodated the plot to a different state of society, and
      has very dexterously connected it with the history of his own times. The
      relation of the trick put on the doting old lover is exquisitely humorous.
      It is far superior to the corresponding passage in the Latin comedy, and
      scarcely yields to the account which Falstaff gives of his ducking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two other comedies without titles, the one in prose, the other in verse,
      appear among the works of Machiavelli. The former is very short, lively
      enough, but of no great value. The latter we can scarcely believe to be
      genuine. Neither its merits nor its defects remind us of the reputed
      author. It was first printed in 1796, from a manuscript discovered in the
      celebrated library of the Strozzi. Its genuineness, if we have been
      rightly informed, is established solely by the comparison of hands. Our
      suspicions are strengthened by the circumstance, that the same manuscript
      contained a description of the plague of 1527, which has also, in
      consequence, been added to the works of Machiavelli. Of this last
      composition, the strongest <span class="pagenum">299</span><a
      name="link299" id="link299"></a>external evidence would scarcely induce us
      to believe him guilty. Nothing was ever written more detestable in matter
      and manner. The narrations, the reflections, the jokes, the lamentations,
      are all the very worst of their respective kinds, at once trite and
      affected, threadbare tinsel from the Rag Fairs and Monmouth Streets of
      literature. A foolish schoolboy might write such a piece, and, after he
      had written it, think it much finer than the incomparable introduction of
      the Decameron. But that a shrewd statesman, whose earliest works are
      characterised by manliness of thought and language, should, at near sixty
      years of age, descend to such puerility, is utterly inconceivable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little novel of Belphegor is pleasantly conceived, and pleasantly
      told. But the extravagance of the satire in some measure injures its
      effect. Machiavelli was unhappily married; and his wish to avenge his own
      cause and that of his brethren in misfortune, carried him beyond even the
      licence of fiction. Jonson seems to have combined some hints taken from
      this tale, with others from Boccaccio, in the plot of The Devil is an Ass,
      a play which, though not the most highly finished of his compositions, is
      perhaps that which exhibits the strongest proofs of genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      The political correspondence of Machiavelli, first published in 1767, is
      unquestionably genuine, and highly valuable. The unhappy circumstances in
      which his country was placed during the greater part of his public life
      gave extraordinary encouragement to diplomatic talents. From the moment
      that Charles the Eighth descended from the Alps, the whole character of
      Italian politics was changed. The governments of the Peninsula ceased to
      form an independent system. Drawn from their old orbit by the attraction
      of the <span class="pagenum">300</span><a name="link300" id="link300"></a>larger
      bodies which now approached them, they became mere satellites of France
      and Spain. All their disputes, internal and external, were decided by
      foreign influence. The contests of opposite factions were carried on, not
      as formerly in the senate-house or in the market-place, but in the
      antechambers of Louis and Ferdinand. Under these circumstances, the
      prosperity of the Italian States depended far more on the ability of their
      foreign agents, than on the conduct of those who were intrusted with the
      domestic administration. The ambassador had to discharge functions far
      more delicate than transmitting orders of knighthood, introducing
      tourists, or presenting his brethren with the homage of his high
      consideration. He was an advocate to whose management the dearest
      interests of his clients were intrusted, a spy clothed with an inviolable
      character. Instead of consulting, by a reserved manner and ambiguous
      style, the dignity of those whom he represented, he was to plunge into all
      the intrigues of the court at which he resided, to discover and flatter
      every weakness of the prince, and of the favourite who governed the
      prince, and of the lacquey who governed the favourite. He was to
      compliment the mistress and bribe the confessor, to panegyrize or
      supplicate, to laugh or weep, to accommodate himself to every caprice, to
      lull every suspicion, to treasure every hint, to be every thing, to
      observe every thing, to endure every thing. High as the art of political
      intrigue had been carried in Italy, these were times which required it
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      On these arduous errands Machiavelli was frequently employed. He was sent
      to treat with the King of the Romans and with the Duke of Valentinois. He
      was twice ambassador at the Court of Rome, and thrice at <span
      class="pagenum">301</span><a name="link301" id="link301"></a>that of
      France. In these missions, and in several others of inferior importance,
      he acquitted himself with great dexterity. His despatches form one of the
      most amusing and instructive collections extant. The narratives are clear
      and agreeably written; the remarks on men and things clever and judicious.
      The conversations are reported in a spirited and characteristic manner. We
      find ourselves introduced into the presence of the men who, during twenty
      eventful years, swayed the destinies of Europe. Their wit and their folly,
      their fretfulness and their merriment, are exposed to us. We are admitted
      to overhear their chat, and to watch their familiar gestures. It is
      interesting and curious to recognise, in circumstances which elude the
      notice of historians, the feeble violence and shallow cunning of Louis the
      Twelfth; the bustling insignificance of Maximilian, cursed with an
      impotent pruriency for renown, rash yet timid, obstinate yet fickle,
      always in a hurry, yet always too late; the fierce and haughty energy
      which gave dignity to the eccentricities of Julius; the soft and graceful
      manners which masked the insatiable ambition and the implacable hatred of
      Cæsar Borgia.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have mentioned Cæsar Borgia. It is impossible not to pause for a moment
      on the name of a man in whom the political morality of Italy was so
      strongly personified, partially blended with the sterner lineaments of the
      Spanish character. On two important occasions Machiavelli was admitted to
      his society; once, at the moment when Cæsar&rsquo;s splendid villany achieved
      its most signal triumph, when he caught in one snare and crushed at one
      blow all his most formidable rivals; and again when, exhausted by disease
      and overwhelmed by misfortunes, which no human prudence <span
      class="pagenum">302</span><a name="link302" id="link302"></a>could
      have averted, he was the prisoner of the deadliest enemy of his house.
      These interviews between the greatest speculative and the greatest
      practical statesmen of the age are folly described in the Correspondence,
      and form perhaps the most interesting part of it. From some passages in
      The Prince, and perhaps also from some indistinct traditions, several
      writers have supposed a connection between those remarkable men much
      closer than ever existed. The Envoy has even been accused of prompting the
      crimes of the artful and merciless tyrant. But from the official documents
      it is clear that their intercourse, though ostensibly amicable, was in
      reality hostile. It cannot be doubted, however, that the imagination of
      Machiavelli was strongly impressed, and his speculations on government
      coloured, by the observations which he made on the singular character and
      equally singular fortunes of a man who under such disadvantages had
      achieved such exploits; who, when sensuality, varied through innumerable
      forms, could no longer stimulate his sated mind, found a more powerful and
      durable excitement in the intense thirst of empire and revenge; who
      emerged from the sloth and luxury of the Roman purple the first prince and
      general of the age; who, trained in an unwarlike profession, formed a
      gallant army out of the dregs of an unwarlike people; who, after acquiring
      sovereignty by destroying his enemies, acquired popularity by destroying
      his tools; who had begun to employ for the most salutary ends the power
      which he had attained by the most atrocious means; who tolerated within
      the sphere of his iron despotism no plunderer or oppressor but himself;
      and who fell at last amidst the mingled curses and regrets of a people of
      whom his genius had been the wonder, and might <span class="pagenum">303</span><a
      name="link303" id="link303"></a>have been the salvation. Some of those
      crimes of Borgia which to ns appear the most odious would not, from causes
      which we have already considered, have struck an Italian of the fifteenth
      century with equal horror. Patriotic feeling also might induce Machiavelli
      to look with some indulgence and regret on the o o memory of the only
      leader who could have defended the independence of Italy against the
      confederate spoilers of Cambray.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this subject Machiavelli felt most strongly. Indeed the expulsion of
      the foreign tyrants, and the restoration of that golden age which had
      preceded the irruption of Charles the Eighth, were projects which, at that
      time, fascinated all the master-spirits of Italy. The magnificent vision
      delighted the great but ill-regulated mind of Julius. It divided with
      manuscripts and sauces, painters and falcons, the attention of the
      frivolous Leo. It prompted the generous treason of Morone. It imparted a
      transient energy to the feeble mind and body of the last Sforza. It
      excited for one moment an honest ambition in the false heart of Pescara.
      Ferocity and insolence were not among the vices of the national character.
      To the discriminating Cruelties of politicians, committed for great ends
      on select victims, the moral code of the Italians was too indulgent. But
      though they might have recourse to barbarity as an expedient, they did not
      require it as a stimulant. They turned with loathing from the atrocity of
      the strangers who seemed to love blood for its own sake, who, not content
      with subjugating, were impatient to destroy, who found a fiendish pleasure
      in razing magnificent cities, cutting the throats of enemies who cried for
      quarter, or suffocating an unarmed population by thousands in the caverns
      to which it had fled <span class="pagenum">304</span><a name="link304"
       id="link304"></a>for safety. Such were the cruelties which daily excited
      the terror and disgust of a people among whom, till lately, the worst that
      a soldier had to fear in a pitched battle was the loss of his horse and
      the expense of his ransom. The swinish intemperance of Switzerland, the
      wolfish avarice of Spain, the gross licentiousness of the French, indulged
      in violation of hospitality, of decency, of love itself, the wanton
      inhumanity which was common to all the invaders, had made them objects of
      deadly hatred to the inhabitants of the Peninsula. The wealth which had
      been accumulated during centuries of prosperity and repose was rapidly
      melting away. The intellectual superiority of the oppressed people only
      rendered them more keenly sensible of their political degradation.
      Literature and taste, indeed, still disguised with a flush of hectic
      loveliness and brilliancy the ravages of an incurable decay. The iron had
      not yet entered into the soul. The time was not yet come when eloquence
      was to be gagged, and reason to be hoodwinked, when the harp of the poet
      was to be hung on the willows of Arno, and the right hand of the painter
      to forget its cunning. Yet a discerning eye might even then have seen that
      genius and learning would not long survive the state of things from which
      they had sprung, and that the great men whose talents gave lustre to that
      melancholy period had been formed under the influence of happier days, and
      would leave no successors behind them. The times which shine with the
      greatest splendour in literary history are not always those to which the
      human mind is most indebted. Of this we may be convinced, by comparing the
      generation which follows them with that which had preceded them. The first
      fruits which are reaped under a bad system often spring from seed <span
      class="pagenum">305</span><a name="link305" id="link305"></a>sown
      under a good one. Thus it was, in some measure, with the Augustan age.
      Thus it was with the age of Raphael and Ariosto, of Aldus and Vida.
    </p>
    <p>
      Machiavelli deeply regretted the misfortunes of his country, and clearly
      discerned the cause and the remedy. It was the military system of the
      Italian people which had extinguished their valor and discipline, and left
      their wealth an easy prey to every foreign plunderer. The Secretary
      projected a scheme alike honourable to his heart and to his intellect, for
      abolishing the use of mercenary troops, and for organizing a national
      militia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exertions which he made to effect this great object ought alone to
      rescue his name from obloquy. Though his situation and his habits were
      pacific, he studied with intense assiduity the theory of war. He made
      himself master of all its details. The Florentine government entered into
      his views. A council of war was appointed. Levies were decreed. The
      indefatigable minister flew from place to place in order to superintend
      the execution of his design. The times were, in some respects, favourable
      to the experiment. The system of military tactics had undergone a great
      revolution. The cavalry was no longer considered as forming the strength
      of an army. The hours which a citizen could spare from his ordinary
      employments, though by no means sufficient to familiarise him with the
      exercise of a man-at-arms, might render him an useful foot-soldier. The
      dread of a foreign yoke, of plunder, massacre, and conflagration, might
      have conquered that repugnance to military pursuits which both the
      industry and the idleness of great towns commonly generate. For a time the
      scheme promised well. The new troops acquitted themselves respectably in
      the <span class="pagenum">306</span><a name="link306" id="link306"></a>field.
      Machiavelli looked with parental rapture on the success of his plan, and
      began to hope that the arms of Italy might once more be formidable to the
      barbarians of the Tagus and the Rhine. But the tide of misfortune came on
      before the barriers which should have withstood it were prepared. For a
      time, indeed, Florence might be considered as peculiarly fortunate. Famine
      and sword and pestilence had devastated the fertile plains and stately
      cities of the Po. All the curses denounced of old against Tyre seemed to
      have fallen on Venice. Her merchants already stood afar off, lamenting for
      their great city. The time seemed near when the sea-weed should overgrow
      her silent Rialto, and the fisherman wash his nets in her deserted
      arsenal. Naples had been four times conquered and reconquered by tyrants
      equally indifferent to its welfare, and equally greedy for its spoils.
      Florence, as yet, had only to endure degradation and extortion, to submit
      to the mandates of foreign powers, to buy over and over again, at an
      enormous price, what was already justly her own, to return thanks for
      being wronged, and to ask pardon for being in the right. She was at length
      deprived of the blessings even of this infamous and servile repose. Her
      military and political institutions were swept away together. The Medici
      returned, in the train of foreign invaders, from their long exile. The
      policy of Machiavelli was abandoned; and his public services were requited
      with poverty, imprisonment, and torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fallen statesman still clung to his project with unabated ardour. With
      the view of vindicating it from some popular objections and of refuting
      some prevailing errors on the subject of military science, he wrote his
      seven books on the Art of War. This excellent <span class="pagenum">307</span><a
      name="link307" id="link307"></a>work is in the form of a dialogue. The
      opinions of the writer are put into the mouth of Fabrizio Colonna, a
      powerful nobleman of the Ecclesiastical State, and an officer of
      distinguished merit in the service of the King of Spain. Colonna visits
      Florence on his way from Lombardy to his own domains. He is invited to
      meet some friends at the house of Cosimo Rucellai, an amiable and
      accomplished young man, whose early death Machiavelli feelingly deplores.
      After partaking of an elegant entertainment, they retire from the heat
      into the most shady recesses of the garden. Fabrizio is struck by the
      sight of some uncommon plants. Cosimo says that, though rare, in modern
      days, they are frequently mentioned by the classical authors, and that his
      grandfather, like many other Italians, amused himself with practising the
      ancient methods of gardening. Fabrizio expresses his regret that those
      who, in later times, affected the manners of the old Romans should select
      for imitation the most trifling pursuits. This leads to a conversation on
      the decline of military discipline and on the best means of restoring it.
      The institution of the Florentine militia is ably defended; and several
      improvements are suggested in the details.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Swiss and the Spaniards were, at that time, regarded as the best
      soldiers in Europe. The Swiss battalion consisted of pikemen, and bore a
      close resemblance to the Greek phalanx. The Spaniards, like the soldiers
      of Rome, were armed with the sword and the shield. The victories of
      Flamininus and Æmilius over the Macedonian kings seem to prove the
      superiority of the weapons used by the legions. The same experiment had
      been recently tried with the same result at the battle of Ravenna, one of
      those <span class="pagenum">308</span><a name="link308" id="link308"></a>tremendous
      days into which human folly and wickedness compress the whole devastation
      of a famine or a plague. In that memorable conflict, the infantry of
      Arragon, the old companions of Gonsalvo, deserted by all their allies,
      hewed a passage through the thickest of the imperial pikes, and effected
      an unbroken retreat, in the face of the gendarmerie of De Foix, and the
      renowned artillery of Este. Fabrizio, or rather Machiavelli, proposes to
      combine the two systems, to arm the foremost lines with the pike for the
      purpose of repulsing cavalry, and those in the rear with the sword, as
      being a weapon better adapted for every other purpose. Throughout the
      work, the author expresses the highest admiration of the military science
      of the ancient Romans, and the greatest contempt for the maxims which had
      been in vogue amongst the Italian commanders of the preceding generation.
      He prefers infantry to cavalry, and fortified camps to fortified towns. He
      is inclined to substitute rapid movements and decisive engagements for the
      languid and dilatory operations of his countrymen. He attaches very little
      importance to the invention of gunpowder. Indeed he seems to think that it
      ought scarcely to produce any change in the mode of arming or of disposing
      troops. The general testimony of historians, it must be allowed, seems to
      prove that the ill-constructed and ill-served artillery of those times,
      though useful in a siege, was of little value on the field of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the tactics of Machiavelli we will not venture to give an opinion: but
      we are certain that his book is most able and interesting. As a commentary
      on the history of his times, it is invaluable. The ingenuity, the grace,
      and the perspicuity of the style, and the <span class="pagenum">309</span><a
      name="link309" id="link309"></a>eloquence and animation of particular
      passages, must give pleasure even to readers who take no interest in the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince and the Discourses on Livy were written after the fall of the
      Republican Government. The former was dedicated to the Young Lorenzo de&rsquo;
      Medici. This circumstance seems to have disgusted the contemporaries of
      the writer far more than the doctrines which have rendered the name of the
      work odious in later times. It was considered as an indication of
      political apostasy. The fact however seems to have been that Machiavelli,
      despairing of the liberty of Florence, was inclined to support any
      government which might preserve her independence. The interval which
      separated a democracy and a despotism, Soderini and Lorenzo, seemed to
      vanish when compared with the difference between the former and the
      present state of Italy, between the security, the opulence, and the repose
      which she had enjoyed under its native rulers, and the misery in which she
      had been plunged since the fatal year in which the first foreign tyrant
      had descended from the Alps. The noble and pathetic exhortation with which
      The Prince concludes shows how strongly the writer felt upon this subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince traces the progress of an ambitious man, the Discourses the
      progress of an ambitious people. The same principles on which, in the
      former work, the elevation of an individual is explained, are applied in
      the latter, to the longer duration and more complex interest of a society.
      To a modern statesman the form of the Discourses may appear to be puerile.
      In truth Livy is not an historian on whom implicit reliance can be placed,
      even in cases where he must have possessed considerable means of <span
      class="pagenum">310</span><a name="link310" id="link310"></a>information.
      And the first Decade, to which Machiavelli has confined himself, is
      scarcely entitled to more credit than our Chronicle of British Kings who
      reigned before the Roman invasion. But the commentator is indebted to Livy
      for little more than a few texts which he might as easily have extracted
      from the Vulgate or the Decameron. The whole train of thought is original.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the peculiar immorality which has rendered The Prince unpopular, and
      which is almost equally discernible in the Discourses, we have already
      given our opinion at length. We have attempted to show that it belonged
      rather to the age than to the man, that it was a partial taint, and by no
      means implied general depravity. We cannot however deny that it is a great
      blemish, and that it considerably diminishes the pleasure which, in other
      respects, those works must afford to every intelligent mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, indeed, impossible to conceive a more healthful and vigorous
      constitution of the understanding than that which these works indicate.
      The qualities of the active and the contemplative statesman appear to have
      been blended in the mind of the writer into a rare and exquisite harmony.
      His skill in the details of business had not been acquired at the expense
      of his general powers. It had not rendered his mind less comprehensive;
      but it had served to correct his speculations, and to impart to them that
      vivid and practical character which so widely distinguishes them from the
      vague theories of most political philosophers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every man who has seen the world knows that nothing is so useless as a
      general maxim. If it be very moral and very true, it may serve for a copy
      to a charity-boy. If, like those of Rochefoucault, it be sparkling and
      whimsical, it may make an excellent <span class="pagenum">311</span><a
      name="link311" id="link311"></a>motto for an essay. But few indeed of the
      many wise apophthegms which have been uttered, from the time of the Seven
      Sages of Greece to that of Poor Richard, have prevented a single foolish
      action. We give the highest and the most peculiar praise to the precepts
      of Machiavelli when we say that they may frequently be of real use in
      regulating conduct, not so much because they are more just or more
      profound than those which might be culled from other authors, as because
      they can be more readily applied to the problems of real life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are errors in these works. But they are errors which a writer,
      situated like Machiavelli, could scarcely avoid. They arise, for the most
      part, from a single defect which appears to us to pervade his whole
      system. In his political scheme, the means had been more deeply considered
      than the ends. The great principle, that societies and laws exist only for
      the purpose of increasing the sum of private happiness, is not recognised
      with sufficient clearness. The good of the body, distinct from the good of
      the members, and sometimes hardly compatible with the good of the members,
      seems to be the object which he proposes to himself. Of all political
      fallacies, this has perhaps had the widest and the most mischievous
      operation. The state of society in the little commonwealths of Greece, the
      close connection and mutual dependence of the citizens, and the severity
      of the laws of war, tended to encourage an opinion which, under such
      circumstances, could hardly be called erroneous. The interests of every
      individual were inseparably bound up with those of the state. An invasion
      destroyed his corn-fields and vineyards, drove him from his home, and
      compelled him to encounter all the hardships of a military <span
      class="pagenum">312</span><a name="link312" id="link312"></a>life. A
      treaty of peace restored him to security and comfort. A victory doubled
      the number of his slaves. A defeat perhaps made him a slave himself. When
      Pericles, in the Peloponnesian war, told the Athenians, that, if their
      country triumphed, their private losses would speedily be repaired, but
      that, if their arms failed of success, every individual amongst them would
      probably be ruined, he spoke no more than the truth. He spoke to men whom
      the tribute of vanquished cities supplied with food and clothing, with the
      luxury of the bath and the amusements of the theatre, on whom the
      greatness of their country conferred rank, and before whom the members of
      less prosperous communities trembled; to men who, in case of a change in
      the public fortunes, would, at least, be deprived of every comfort and
      every distinction which they enjoyed. To be butchered on the smoking ruins
      of their city, to be dragged in chains to a slave-market, to see one child
      torn from them to dig in the quarries of Sicily, and another to guard the
      harems of Per-sepolis, these were the frequent and probable consequences
      of national calamities. Hence, among the Greeks, patriotism became a
      governing principle, or rather an ungovernable passion. Their legislators
      and their philosophers took it for granted that, in providing for the
      strength and greatness of the state, they sufficiently provided for the
      happiness of the people. The writers of the Roman empire lived under
      despots, into whose dominion a hundred nations were melted down, and whose
      gardens would have covered the little commonwealths of Plilius and Platæa.
      Yet they continued to employ the same language, and to cant about the duty
      of sacrificing every thing to a country to which they owed nothing. <span
      class="pagenum">313</span><a name="link313" id="link313"></a>Causes
      similar to those which had influenced the disposition of the Greeks
      operated powerfully on the less vigorous and daring character of the
      Italians. The Italians, like the Greeks, were members of small
      communities. Every man was deeply interested in the welfare of the society
      to which he belonged, a partaker in its wealth and its poverty, in its
      glory and its shame. In the age of Machiavelli this was peculiarly the
      case. Public events had produced an immense sum of misery to private
      citizens. The Northern invaders had brought want to their boards, infamy
      to their beds, fire to their roofs, and the knife to their throats. It was
      natural that a man who lived in times like these should overrate the
      importance of those measures by which a nation is rendered formidable to
      its neighbours, and undervalue those which make it prosperous within
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is more remarkable in the political treatises of Machiavelli than
      the fairness of mind which they indicate. It appears where the author is
      in the wrong, almost as strongly as where he is in the right. He never
      advances a false opinion because it is new or splendid, because he can
      clothe it in a happy phrase, or defend it by an ingenious sophism. His
      errors are at once explained by a reference to the circumstances in which
      he was placed. They evidently were not sought out; they lay in his way,
      and could scarcely be avoided. Such mistakes must necessarily be committed
      by early speculators in every science.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this respect it is amusing to compare The Prince and the Discourses
      with the Spirit of Laws. Montesquieu enjoys, perhaps, a wider celebrity
      than any political writer of modern Europe. Something he doubtless owes to
      his merit, but much more to his fortune. <span class="pagenum">314</span><a
      name="link314" id="link314"></a>He had the good luck of a Valentine. He
      caught the eye of the French nation, at the moment when it was waking from
      the long sleep of political and religious bigotry; and, in consequence, he
      became a favourite. The English, at that time, considered a Frenchman who
      talked about constitutional checks and fundamental laws as a prodigy not
      less astonishing than the learned pig or the musical infant. Specious but
      shallow, studious of effect, indifferent to truth, eager to build a
      system, but careless of collecting those materials out of which alone a
      sound and durable system can be built, the lively President constructed
      theories as rapidly and as slightly as card-houses, no sooner projected
      than completed, no sooner completed than blown away, no sooner blown away
      than forgotten. Machiavelli errs only because his experience, acquired in
      a very peculiar state of society, could not always enable him to calculate
      the effect of institutions differing from those of which he had observed
      the operation. Montesquieu errs, because he has a fine thing to say, and
      is resolved to say it. If the phænomena which lie before him will not suit
      his purpose, all history must be ransacked. If nothing established by
      authentic testimony can be racked or chipped to suit his Procrustean
      hypothesis, he puts up with some monstrous fable about Siam, or Bantam, or
      Japan, told by writers compared with whom Lucian and Gulliver were
      veracious, liars by a double right, as travellers and as Jesuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Propriety of thought, and propriety of diction, are commonly found
      together. Obscurity and affectation are the two greatest faults of style.
      Obscurity of expression generally springs from confusion of ideas; and the
      same wish to dazzle at any cost which produces affectation in the manner
      of a writer, is likely to produce <span class="pagenum">315</span><a
      name="link315" id="link315"></a>sophistry in his reasonings. The judicious
      and candid mind of Machiavelli shows itself in his luminous, manly, and
      polished language. The style of Montesquieu, on the other hand, indicates
      in every page a lively and ingenious, but an unsound mind. Every trick of
      expression, from the mysterious conciseness of an oracle to the flippancy
      of a Parisian coxcomb, is employed to disguise the fallacy of some
      positions, and the triteness of others. Absurdities are brightened into
      epigrams; truisms are darkened into enigmas. It is with difficulty that
      the strongest eye can sustain the glare with which some parts are
      illuminated, or penetrate the shade in which others are concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The political works of Machiavelli derive a peculiar interest from the
      mournful earnestness which he manifests whenever he touches on topics
      connected with the calamities of his native land. It is difficult to
      conceive any situation more painful than that of a great man, condemned to
      watch the lingering agony of an exhausted country, to tend it during the
      alternate fits of stupefaction and raving which precede its dissolution,
      and to see the symptoms of vitality disappear one by one, till nothing is
      left but coldness, darkness, and corruption. To this joyless and thankless
      duty was Machiavelli called. In the energetic language of the prophet, he
      was &ldquo;mad for the sight of his eyes which he saw,&rdquo; disunion in the council,
      effeminacy in the camp, liberty extinguished, commerce decaying, national
      honour sullied, an enlightened and flourishing people given over to the
      ferocity of ignorant savages. Though his opinions had not escaped the
      contagion of that political immorality which was common among his:
      countrymen, his natural disposition seems to have been <span
      class="pagenum">316</span><a name="link316" id="link316"></a>rather
      stern and impetuous than pliant and artful. When the misery and
      degradation of Florence and the foul outrage which he had himself
      sustained recur to his mind the smooth craft of his profession and his
      nation is exchanged for the honest bitterness of scorn and anger. He
      speaks like one sick of the calamitous times and abject people among whom
      his lot is cast. He pines for the strength and glory of ancient Rome, for
      the fasces of Brutus and the sword of Scipio, the gravity of the curule
      chair, and the bloody pomp of the triumphal sacrifice. He seems to be
      transported back to the days when eight hundred thousand Italian warriors
      sprung to arms at the rumor of a Gallic invasion. He breathes all the
      spirit of those intrepid and haughty senators who forgot the dearest ties
      of nature in the claims of public duty, who looked with disdain on the
      elephants and on the gold of Pyrrhus, and listened with unaltered
      composure to the tremendous tidings of Cannae. Like an ancient temple
      deformed by the barbarous architecture of a later age, his character
      acquires an interest from the very circumstances which debase it. The
      original proportions are rendered more striking by the contrast which they
      present to the mean and incongruous additions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The influence of the sentiments which we have described was not apparent
      in his writings alone. His enthusiasm, barred from the career which it
      would have selected for itself, seems to have found a vent in desperate
      levity. He enjoyed a vindictive pleasure in outraging the opinions of a
      society which he despised. He became careless of the decencies which were
      expected from a man so highly distinguished in the literary and political
      world. The sarcastic bitterness <span class="pagenum">317</span><a
      name="link317" id="link317"></a>of his conversation disgusted those who
      were more inclined to accuse his licentiousness than their own degeneracy,
      and who were unable to conceive the strength of those emotions which are
      concealed by the jests of the wretched, and by the follies of the wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The historical works of Machiavelli still remain to be considered. The
      life of Castruccio Castracani will occupy us for a very short time, and
      would scarcely have demanded our notice, had it not attracted a much
      greater share of public attention than it deserves. Few books, indeed,
      could be more interesting than a careful and judicious account, from such
      a pen, of the illustrious Prince of Lucca, the most eminent of those
      Italian chiefs, who like Pisistratus and Gelon, acquired a power felt
      rather than seen, and resting, not on law or on prescription, but on the
      public favour and on their great personal qualities. Such a work would
      exhibit to us the real nature of that species of sovereignty, so singular
      and so often misunderstood, which the Greeks denominated tyranny, and
      which, modified in some degree by the feudal system, reappeared in the
      commonwealths of Lombardy and Tuscany. But this little composition of
      Machiavelli is in no sense a history. It has no pretensions to fidelity.
      It is a trifle, and not a very successful trifle. It is scarcely more
      authentic than the novel of Belphegor, and is very much duller.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last great work of this illustrious man was the history of his native
      city. It was written by command of the Pope, who, as chief of the house of
      Medici, was at that time sovereign of Florence. The characters of Cosmo,
      of Piero, and of Lorenzo, are, however, treated with a freedom and
      impartiality equally honourable <span class="pagenum">318</span><a
      name="link318" id="link318"></a>to the writer and to the patron. The
      miseries and humiliations of dependence, the bread which is more bitter
      than every other food, the stairs which are more painful than every other
      ascent, had not broken the spirit of Machiavelli. The most corrupting post
      in a corrupting profession had not depraved the generous heart of Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The History does not appear to be the fruit of much industry or research.
      It is unquestionably inaccurate. But it is elegant, lively, and
      picturesque, beyond any other in the Italian language. The reader, we
      believe, carries away from it a more vivid and a more faithful impression
      of the national character and manners than from more correct accounts. The
      truth is, that the book belongs rather to ancient than to modern
      literature. It is in the style, not of Davila and Clarendon, but of
      Herodotus and Tacitus. The classical histories may almost be called
      romances founded in fact. The relation is, no doubt, in all its principal
      points, strictly true. But the numerous little incidents which heighten
      the interest, the words, the gestures, the looks, are evidently furnished
      by the imagination of the author. The fashion of later times is different.
      A more exact narrative is given by the writer. It may be doubted whether
      more exact notions are conveyed to the reader. The best portraits are
      perhaps those in which there is a slight mixture of caricature, and we are
      not certain, that the best histories are not those in which a little of
      the exaggeration of fictitious narrative is judiciously employed.
      Something is lost in accuracy; but much is gained in effect. The fainter
      lines are neglected; but the great characteristic features are imprinted
      on the mind for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The History terminates with the death of Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici. <span
      class="pagenum">319</span><a name="link319" id="link319"></a>Machiavelli
      had, it seems, intended to continue his narrative to a later period. But
      his death prevented the execution of his design; and the melancholy task
      of recording the desolation and shame of Italy devolved on Guicciardini.
    </p>
    <p>
      Machiavelli lived long enough to see the commencement of the last struggle
      for Florentine liberty. Soon after his death monarchy was finally
      established, not such a monarchy as that of which Cosmo had laid the
      foundations deep in the institutions and feelings of his countrymen, and
      which Lorenzo had embellished with the trophies of every science and every
      art; but a loathsome tyranny, proud and mean, cruel and feeble, bigotted
      and lascivious. The character of Machiavelli was hateful to the new
      masters of Italy; and those parts of his theory which were in strict
      accordance with their own daily practice afforded a pretext for blackening
      his memory. His works were misrepresented by the learned, misconstrued by
      the ignorant, censured by the church, abused with all the rancour of
      simulated virtue, by the tools of a base government, and the priests of a
      baser superstition. The name of the man whose genius had illuminated all
      the dark places of policy, and to whose patriotic wisdom an oppressed
      people had owed their last chance of emancipation and revenge, passed into
      a proverb of infamy. For more than two hundred years his bones lay
      undistinguished. At length, an English nobleman paid the last honours to
      the greatest statesman of Florence. In the church of Santa Croce a
      monument was erected to his memory, which is contemplated with reverence
      by all who can distinguish the virtues of a great mind through the
      corruptions of a degenerate age, and which will be approached with still
      deeper homage when the object to <span class="pagenum">320</span><a
      name="link320" id="link320"></a>which his public life was devoted shall be
      attained, when the foreign yoke shall be broken, when a second Procida
      shall avenge the wrongs of Naples, when a happier Rienzi shall restore the
      good estate of Rome, when the streets of Florence and Bologna shall again
      resound with their ancient war-cry, <i>Popolo; popolo; muoano i tiranni!</i>

      Review</i>, January 1828.) <br /> <span class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap"
        style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span><br />he public voice has assigned to
      Dryden the first place in the second rank of our poets,&mdash;no mean
      station in a table of intellectual precedency so rich in illustrious
      names. It is allowed that, even of the few who were his superiors in
      genius, none has exercised a more extensive or permanent influence on the
      national habits of thought and expression. His life was commensurate with
      the period during which a great revolution in the public taste was
      effected; and in that revolution he played the part of Cromwell. By
      unscrupulously taking the lead in its wildest excesses, he obtained the
      absolute guidance of it. By trampling on laws, he acquired the authority
      of a legislator. By signalising himself as the most daring and irreverent
      of rebels, he raised himself to the dignity of a recognised prince. He
      commenced his career by the most frantic outrages. He terminated it in the
      repose of established sovereignty,&mdash;the author of a new code, the
      root of a new dynasty. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Dryden, however, as of almost every man who has been distinguished
      either in the literary or in the political world, it may be said that the
      course which he

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">322</span><a name="link322" id="link322"></a>pursued,
      and the effect which he produced, depended less on his personal qualities
      than on the circumstances in which he was placed. Those who have read
      history with discrimination know the fallacy of those panegyrics and
      invectives which represent individuals as effecting great moral and
      intellectual revolutions, subverting established systems, and imprinting a
      new character on their age. The difference between one man and another is
      by no means so great as the superstitious crowd supposes. But the same
      feelings which in ancient Rome produced the apotheosis of a popular
      emperor, and in modern Rome the canonisation of a devout prelate, led men
      to cherish an illusion which furnishes them with something to adore. By a
      law of association, from the operation of which even minds the most
      strictly regulated by reason are not wholly exempt, misery disposes us to
      hatred, and happiness to love, although there may be no person to whom our
      misery or our happiness can be ascribed. The peevishness of an invalid
      vents itself even on those who alleviate his pain. The good humour of a
      man elated by success often displays itself towards enemies. In the same
      manner, the feelings of pleasure and admiration, to which the
      contemplation of great events gives birth, make an object where they do
      not find it. Thus, nations descend to the absurdities of Egyptian
      idolatry, and worship stocks and reptiles&mdash;Sacheverells and Wilkeses.
      They even fall prostrate before a deity to which they have themselves
      given the form which commands their veneration, and which, unless
      fashioned by them, would have remained a shapeless block. They persuade
      themselves that they are the creatures of what they have themselves
      created. For, in fact, it is the age that forms the man, not the man that
      <span class="pagenum">323</span><a name="link323" id="link323"></a>forms
      the age. Great minds do indeed only pay with interest what they have
      received. We extol Bacon and sneer at Aquinas. But, if their situations
      had been changed, Bacon might have been the Angelical Doctor, the most
      subtle Aristotelian of the schools; the Dominican might have led forth the
      sciences from their house of bondage. If Luther had been born in the tenth
      century, he would have effected no reformation. If he had never been born
      at all, it is evident that the sixteenth century could not have elapsed
      without a great schism in the church. Voltaire, in the days of Louis the
      Fourteenth, would probably have been, like most of the literary men of
      that time, a zealous Jansenist, eminent among the defenders of efficacious
      grace, a bitter assailant of the lax morality of the Jesuits and the
      unreasonable decisions of the Sorbonne. If Pascal had entered on his
      literary career when intelligence was more general, and abuses at the same
      time more flagrant, when the church was polluted by the Iscariot Dubois,
      the court disgraced by the orgies of Canillac, and the nation sacrificed
      to the juggles of Law, if he had lived to see a dynasty of harlots, an
      empty treasury and a crowded harem, an army formidable only to those whom
      it should have protected, a priesthood just religious enough to be
      intolerant, he might possibly, like every man of genius in France, have
      imbibed extravagant prejudices against monarchy and Christianity. The wit
      which blasted the sophisms of Escobar&mdash;the impassioned eloquence
      which defended the sisters of Port Royal&mdash;the intellectual hardihood
      which was not beaten down even by Papal authority&mdash;might have raised
      him to the Patriarchate of the Philosophical <span class="pagenum">324</span><a
      name="link324" id="link324"></a>Church. It was long disputed whether the
      honour of inventing the method of Fluxions belonged to Newton or to
      Leibnitz. It is now generally allowed that these great men made the same
      discovery at the same time. Mathematical science, indeed, had then reached
      such a point that, if neither of them had ever existed, the principle must
      inevitably have occurred to some person within a few years. So in our own
      time the doctrine of rent, now universally received by political
      economists, was propounded, almost at the same moment, by two writers
      unconnected with each other. Preceding speculators had long been
      blundering round about it; and it could not possibly have been missed much
      longer by the most heedless inquirer. We are inclined to think that, with
      respect to every great addition which has been made to the stock of human
      knowledge, the case has been similar; that without Copernicus we should
      have been Copernicans,&mdash;that without Columbus America would have been
      discovered,&mdash;that without Locke we should have possessed a just
      theory of the origin of human ideas. Society indeed has its great men and
      its little men, as the earth has its mountains and its valleys. But the
      inequalities of intellect, like the inequalities of the surface of our
      globe, bear so small a proportion to the mass, that, in calculating its
      great revolutions, they may safely be neglected. The sun illuminates the
      hills, while it is still below the horizon; and truth is discovered by the
      highest minds a little before it becomes manifest to the multitude. This
      is the extent of their superiority. They are the first to catch and
      reflect a light, which, without their assistance, must, in a short time,
      be visible to those who lie far beneath them. <span class="pagenum">325</span><a
      name="link325" id="link325"></a>The same remark will apply equally to the
      fine arts. The laws on which depend the progress and decline of poetry,
      painting, and sculpture, operate with little less certainty than those
      which regulate the periodical returns of heat and cold, of fertility and
      barrenness. Those who seem to lead the public taste are, in general,
      merely outrunning it in the direction which it is spontaneously pursuing.
      Without a just apprehension of the laws to which we have alluded, the
      merits and defects of Dryden can be but imperfectly understood. We will,
      therefore, state what we conceive them to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ages in which the master-pieces of imagination have been produced have
      by no means been those in which taste has been most correct. It seems that
      the creative faculty, and the critical faculty, cannot exist together in
      their highest perfection. The causes of this phenomenon it is not
      difficult to assign.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that the man who is best able to take a machine to pieces, and
      who most clearly comprehends the manner in which all its wheels and
      springs conduce to its general effect, will be the man most competent to
      form another machine of similar power. In all the branches of physical and
      moral science which admit of perfect analysis, he who can resolve will be
      able to combine. But the analysis which criticism can effect of poetry is
      necessarily imperfect. One element must for ever elude its researches; and
      that is the very element by which poetry is poetry. In the description of
      nature, for example, a judicious reader will easily detect an incongruous
      image. But he will find it impossible to explain in what consists the art
      of a writer who, in a few words, brings some spot before him so vividly
      that he shall know it as if he had lived there from childhood; while
      another, employing the <span class="pagenum">326</span><a
      name="link326" id="link326"></a>same materials, the same verdure, the same
      water, and the same flowers, committing no inaccuracy, introducing nothing
      which can be positively pronounced superfluous, omitting nothing which can
      be positively pronounced necessary, shall produce no more effect than an
      advertisement of a capital residence and a desirable pleasure-ground. To
      take another example: the great features of the character of Hotspur are
      obvious to the most superficial reader. We at once perceive that his
      courage is splendid, his thirst of glory intense, his animal spirits high,
      his temper careless, arbitrary, and petulant; that he indulges his own
      humour without caring whose feelings he may wound, or whose enmity he may
      provoke, by his levity. Thus far criticism will go. But something is still
      wanting. A man might have all those qualities, and every other quality
      which the most minute examiner can introduce into his catalogue of the
      virtues and faults of Hotspur, and yet he would not be Hotspur. Almost
      everything that we have said of him applies equally to Falcon bridge. Yet
      in the mouth of Falconbridge most of his speeches would seem out of place.
      In real life this perpetually occurs. We are sensible of nude differences
      between men whom, if we were required to describe them, we should describe
      in almost the same terms. If we were attempting to draw elaborate
      characters of them, we should scarcely be able to point out any strong
      distinction; yet we approach them with feelings altogether dissimilar. We
      cannot conceive of them as using the expressions or the gestures of each
      other. Let us suppose that a zoologist should attempt to give an account
      of some animal, a porcupine for instance, to people who had never seen it.
      The porcupine, he might say, is of the genus mammalia, and the order <span
      class="pagenum">327</span><a name="link327" id="link327"></a>glires.
      There are whiskers on its face; it is two feet long; it has four toes
      before, five behind, two fore teeth, and eight grinders. Its body is
      covered with hair and quills. And, when all this had been said, would any
      one of the auditors have formed a just idea of a porcupine? Would any two
      of them have formed the same idea? There might exist innumerable races of
      animals, possessing all the characteristics which have been mentioned, yet
      altogether unlike to each other. What the description of our naturalist is
      to a real porcupine, the remarks of criticism are to the images of poetry.
      What it so imperfectly decomposes it cannot perfectly re-construct. It is
      evidently as impossible to produce an Othello or a Macbeth by reversing an
      analytical process so defective, as it would be for an anatomist to form a
      living man out of the fragments of his dissecting-room. In both cases the
      vital principle eludes the finest instruments, and vanishes in the very
      instant in which its seat is touched. Hence those who, trusting to their
      critical skill, attempt to write poems give us, not images of things, but
      catalogues of qualities. Their characters are allegories; not good men and
      bad men, but cardinal virtues and deadly sins. We seem to have fallen
      among the acquaintances of our old friend Christian: sometimes we meet
      Mistrust and Timorous; sometimes Mr. Hate-good and Mr. Love-lust; and then
      again Prudence, Piety, and Charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      That critical discernment is not sufficient to make men poets, is
      generally allowed. Why it should keep them from becoming poets, is not
      perhaps equally evident: but the fact is, that poetry requires not an
      examining but a believing frame of mind. Those feel it most, and write it
      best, who forget that it is a work <span class="pagenum">328</span><a
      name="link328" id="link328"></a>of art; to whom its imitations, like the
      realities from which they are taken, are subjects, not for
      connoisseur-ship, but for tears and laughter, resentment and affection;
      who are too much under the influence of the illusion to admire the genius
      which has produced it; who are too much frightened for Ulysses in the cave
      of Polyphemus to care whether the pun about Outis be good or bad; who
      forget that such a person as Shakspeare ever existed, while they weep and
      curse with Lear. It is by giving faith to the creations of the imagination
      that a man becomes a poet. It is by treating those creations as
      deceptions, and by resolving them, as nearly as possible, into their
      elements, that he becomes a critic. In the moment in which the skill of
      the artist is perceived, the spell of the art is broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      These considerations account for the absurdities into which the greatest
      writers have fallen, when they have attempted to give general rules for
      composition, or to pronounce judgment on the works of others. They are
      unaccustomed to analyse what they feel; they, therefore, perpetually refer
      their emotions to causes which have not in the slightest degree tended to
      produce them. They feel pleasure in reading a book. They never consider
      that this pleasure may be the effect of ideas which some unmeaning
      expression, striking on the first link of a chain of associations, may
      have called up in their own minds&mdash;that they have themselves
      furnished to the author the beauties which they admire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cervantes is the delight of all classes of readers. Every school-boy
      thumbs to pieces the most wretched translations of his romance, and knows
      the lantern jaws of the Knight Errant, and the broad cheeks of the Squire,
      as well as the faces of his own playfellow&rsquo;s. <span class="pagenum">329</span><a
      name="link329" id="link329"></a>The most experienced and fastidious judges
      are amazed at the perfection of that art which extracts inextinguishable
      laughter from the greatest of human calamities without once violating the
      reverence due to it; at that discriminating delicacy of touch which makes
      a character exquisitely ridiculous, without impairing its worth, its
      grace, or its dignity. In Don Quixote are several dissertations on the
      principles of poetic and dramatic writing. No passages in the whole work
      exhibit stronger marks of labour and attention; and no passages in any
      work with which we are acquainted are more worthless and puerile. In our
      time they would scarcely obtain admittance into the literary department of
      the Morning Post. Every reader of the Divine Comedy must be struck by the
      veneration which Dante expresses for writers far inferior to himself. He
      will not lift up his eyes from the ground in the presence of Brunetto, all
      whose works are not worth the worst of his own hundred cantos. He does not
      venture to walk in the same line with the bombastic Statius. His
      admiration of Virgil is absolute idolatry. If indeed it had been excited
      by the elegant, splendid, and harmonious diction of the Roman poet, it
      would not have been altogether unreasonable; but it is rather as an
      authority on all points of philosophy, than as a work of imagination, that
      he values the Æneid. The most trivial passages he regards as oracles of
      the highest authority, and of the most recondite meaning. He describes his
      conductor as the sea of all wisdom&mdash;the sun which heals every
      disordered sight. As he judged of Virgil, the Italians of the fourteenth
      century judged of him; they were proud of him; they praised him; they
      struck medals bearing his head; they quarrelled <span class="pagenum">330</span><a
      name="link330" id="link330"></a>for the honour of possessing his remains;
      they maintained professors to expound his writings. But what they admired
      was not that mighty imagination which called a new world into existence,
      and made all its sights and sounds familiar to the eye and ear of the
      mind. They said little of those awful and lovely creations on which later
      critics delight to dwell&mdash;Farinata lifting his haughty and tranquil
      brow from his couch of everlasting fire&mdash;the lion-like repose of
      Sordello&mdash;or the light which shone from the celestial smile of
      Beatrice. They extolled their great poet for his smattering of ancient
      literature and history; for his logic and his divinity; for his absurd
      physics, and his more absurd metaphysics; for everything but that in which
      he preeminently excelled. Like the fool in the story, who ruined his
      dwelling by digging for gold, which, as he had dreamed, was concealed
      under its foundations, they laid waste one of the noblest works of human
      genius, by seeking in it for buried treasures of wisdom which existed only
      in their own wild reveries. The finest passages were little valued till
      they had been debased into some monstrous allegory. Louder applause was
      given to the lecture on fate and free-will, or to the ridiculous
      astronomical theories, than to those tremendous lines which disclose the
      secrets of the tower of hunger, or to that half-told tale of guilty love,
      so passionate and so full of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not mean to say that the contemporaries of Dante read with less
      emotion than their descendants of Ugolino groping among the wasted corpses
      of his children, or of Francesca starting at the tremulous kiss and
      dropping the fatal volume. Far from it. We believe that they admired these
      things less than ourselves, but that they felt them more. We should
      perhaps <span class="pagenum">331</span><a name="link331" id="link331"></a>say
      that they felt them too much to admire them. The progress of a nation from
      barbarism to civilisation produces a change similar to that which takes
      place during the progress of an individual from infancy to mature age.
      What man does not remember with regret the first time that he read
      Robinson Crusoe? Then, indeed, he was unable to appreciate the powers of
      the writer; or, rather, he neither knew nor cared whether the book had a
      writer at all. He probably thought it not half so fine as some rant of
      Macpherson about dark-browed Foldath, and white-bosomed Strinadona.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now values Fingal and Temora only as showing with how little evidence a
      story may be believed, and with how little merit a book may be popular. Of
      the romance of Defoe he entertains the highest opinion. He perceives the
      hand of a master in ten thousand touches which formerly he passed by
      without notice. But, though he understands the merits of the narrative
      better than formerly, he is far less interested by it. Xury and Friday,
      and pretty Poll, the boat with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, and the canoe
      which could not be brought down to the water edge, the tent with its hedge
      and ladders, the preserve of kids, and the den where the old goat died,
      can never again be to him the realities which they were. The days when his
      favourite volume set him upon making wheel-barrows and chairs, upon
      digging caves and fencing huts in the garden, can never return. Such is
      the law of our nature. Our judgment ripens; our imagination decays. We
      cannot at once enjoy the flowers of the spring of life and the fruits of
      its autumn, the pleasures of close investigation and those of agreeable
      error. We cannot sit at once in the front of the stage and behind the
      scenes. We cannot be under the illusion of the <span class="pagenum">332</span><a
      name="link332" id="link332"></a>spectacle, while we are watching the
      movements of the ropes and pulleys which dispose it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chapter in which Fielding describes the behaviour of Partridge at the
      theatre affords so complete an illustration of our proposition, that we
      cannot refrain from quoting some parts of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partridge gave that credit to Mr. Garrick which he had denied to Jones,
      and fell into so violent a trembling that his knees knocked against each
      other. Jones asked him what was the matter, and whether he was afraid of
      the warrior npon the stage?&mdash;&lsquo;O, la, sir,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I perceive now
      it is what you told me. I am not afraid of anything, for I know it is but
      a play; and if it was really a ghost, it could do one no harm at such a
      distance and in so much company; and yet, if I was frightened, I am not
      the only person.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Why, who,&rsquo; cries Jones, &lsquo;dost thou take to be
      such a coward here besides thyself?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Nay, you may call me a coward
      if you will; but if that little man there npon the stage is not
      frightened, I never saw any man frightened in my life.&rsquo;.... He sat with
      his eyes fixed partly on the ghost and partly on Hamlet, and with his
      mouth open; the same passions which succeeded each other in Hamlet,
      succeeding likewise in him.......
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little more worth remembering occurred during the play, at the end of
      which Jones asked him which of the players he liked best. To this he
      answered, with some appearance of indignation at the question, &lsquo;The King,
      without doubt.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Indeed, Mr. Partridge,&rsquo; says Mrs. Miller, &lsquo;you are
      not of the same opinion with the town; for they are all agreed that Hamlet
      is acted by the best player who was ever on the stage.&rsquo; &lsquo;He the best
      player!&rsquo; cries Partridge, with a contemptuous sneer; &lsquo;why I could act as
      well as he myself. I am sure, if I had seen a ghost, I should have looked
      in the very same manner, and done just as he did. And then, to be sure, in
      that scene, as you called it, between him and his mother, where you told
      me he acted so fine, why, any man, that is, any good man, that had such a
      mother, would have done exactly the same. I know you are only joking with
      me; but indeed, madam, though I never was at a play in London, yet I have
      seen acting before in the country, and the King, for my money, he speaks
      all his words distinctly, and half as loud again as the other. Anybody may
      see he is an actor.&rsquo;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">333</span><a
      name="link333" id="link333"></a>In this excellent passage Partridge is
      represented as a very bad theatrical critic. But none of those who laugh
      at him possess the tithe of his sensibility to theatrical excellence. He
      admires in the wrong place; but he trembles in the right place. It is
      indeed because he is so much excited by the acting of Garrick, that he
      ranks him below the strutting, mouthing performer, who personates the
      King. So, we have heard it said that, in some parts of Spain and Portugal,
      an actor who should represent a depraved character finely, instead of
      calling down the applauses of the audience, is hissed and pelted without
      mercy. It would be the same in England, if we, for one moment, thought
      that Shylock or Iago was standing before us. While the dramatic art was in
      its infancy at Athens, it produced similar effects on the ardent and
      imaginative spectators. It is said that they blamed Æschylus for
      frightening them into fits with his Furies. Herodotus tells us that, when
      Phrynichus produced his tragedy on the fall of Miletus, they fined him in
      a penalty of a thousand drachmas for torturing their feelings by so
      pathetic an exhibition. They did not regard him as a great artist, but
      merely as a man who had given them pain. When they woke from the
      distressing illusion, they treated the author of it as they would have
      treated a messenger who should have brought them fatal and alarming
      tidings which turned out to be false. In the same manner, a child screams
      with terror at the sight of a person in an ugly mask. He has perhaps seen
      the mask put on. But his imagination is too strong for his reason; and he
      intreats that it may be taken off.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should act in the same manner if the grief and horror produced in us by
      works of the imagination amounted to real torture. But in us these
      emotions are <span class="pagenum">334</span><a name="link334"
       id="link334"></a>comparatively languid. They rarely affect our appetite or
      our sleep. They leave us sufficiently at ease to trace them to their
      causes, and to estimate the powers which produce them. Our attention is
      speedily diverted from the images which call forth our tears to the art by
      which those images have been selected and combined. We applaud the genius
      of the writer. We applaud our own sagacity and sensibility; and we are
      comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, though, we think that in the progress of nations towards refinement
      the reasoning powers are improved at the expense of the imagination, we
      acknowledge that to this rule there are many apparent exceptions. We are
      not, however, quite satisfied that they are more than apparent. Men
      reasoned better, for example, in the time of Elizabeth than in the time of
      Egbert; and they also wrote better poetry. But we must distinguish between
      poetry as a mental act, and poetry as a species of composition. If we take
      it in the latter sense, its excellence depends, not solely on the vigour
      of the imagination, but partly also on the instruments which the
      imagination employs. Within certain limits, therefore, poetry may he
      improving while the poetical faculty is decaying. The vividness of the
      picture presented to the reader is not necessarily proportioned to the
      vividness of the prototype which exists in the mind of the writer. In the
      other arts we see this clearly. Should a man, gifted by nature with all
      the genius of Canova, attempt to carve a statue without instruction as to
      the management of his chisel, or attention to the anatomy of the human
      body, he would produce something compared with which the Highlander at the
      door of a snuff shop would deserve admiration. If an uninitiated Raphael
      were to attempt <span class="pagenum">335</span><a name="link335"
       id="link335"></a>a painting, it would be a mere daub; indeed, the
      connoisseurs say that the early works of Raphael are little better. Yet,
      who can attribute this to want of imagination? Who can doubt that the
      youth of that great artist was passed amidst an ideal world of beautiful
      and majestic forms? Or, who will attribute the difference which appears
      between his first rude essays and his magnificent Transfiguration to a
      change in the constitution of his mind? In poetry, as in painting and
      sculpture, it is necessary that the imitator should be well acquainted
      with that which he undertakes to imitate, and expert in the mechanical
      part of his art. Genius will not furnish him with a vocabulary: it will
      not teach him what word most exactly corresponds to his idea, and will
      most fully convey it to others: it will not make him a great descriptive
      poet, till he has looked with attention on the face of nature; or a great
      dramatist, till he has felt and witnessed much of the influence of the
      passions. Information and experience are, therefore, necessary; not for
      the purpose of strengthening the imagination, which is never so strong as
      in people incapable of reasoning&mdash;savages, children, madmen, and
      dreamers; but for the purpose of enabling the artist to communicate his
      conceptions to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a barbarous age the imagination exercises a despotic power. So strong
      is the perception of what is unreal that it often overpowers all the
      passions of the mind and all the sensations of the body. At first, indeed,
      the phantasm remains undivulged, a hidden treasure, a wordless poetry, an
      invisible painting, a silent music, a dream of which the pains and
      pleasures exist to the dreamer alone, a bitterness which the heart only
      knoweth, a joy with which a stranger intermeddleth not. The machinery, by
      which ideas are to be conveyed <span class="pagenum">336</span><a
      name="link336" id="link336"></a>from one person to another, is as yet rude
      and defective. Between mind and mind there is a great gulf. The imitative
      arts do not exist, or are in their lowest state. But the actions of men
      amply prove that the faculty which gives birth to those arts is morbidly
      active. It is not yet the inspiration of poets and sculptors; but it is
      the amusement of the day, the terror of the night, the fertile source of
      wild superstitions. It turns the clouds into gigantic shapes, and the
      winds into doleful voices. The belief which springs from it is more
      absolute and undoubting than any which can be derived from evidence. It
      resembles the faith which we repose in our own sensations. Thus, the Arab,
      when covered with wounds, saw nothing but the dark eyes and the green
      kerchief of a beckoning Houri. The Northern warrior laughed in the pangs
      of death when he thought of the mead of Valhalla.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first works of the imagination are, as we have said, poor and rude,
      not from the want of genius, but from the want of materials. Phidias could
      have done nothing with an old tree and a fish-bone, or Homer with the
      language of New Holland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the effect of these early performances, imperfect as they must
      necessarily be, is immense. All deficiencies are supplied by the
      susceptibility of those to whom they are addressed. We all know what
      pleasure a wooden doll, which may be bought for sixpence, will afford to a
      little girl. She will require no other company. She will nurse it, dress
      it, and talk to it all day. No grown-up man takes half so much delight in
      one of the incomparable babies of Chantrey. In the same manner, savages
      are more affected by the rude compositions of their bards than nations
      more advanced in civilisation by the greatest master-pieces of poetry.
      <span class="pagenum">337</span><a name="link337" id="link337"></a>In
      process of time, the instruments by which the imagination works are
      brought to perfection. Men have not more imagination than their rude
      ancestors. We strongly suspect that they have much less. But they produce
      better works of imagination. Thus, up to a certain period, the diminution
      of the poetical powers is far more than compensated by the improvement of
      all the appliances and means of which those powers stand in need. Then
      comes the short period of splendid and consummate excellence. And then,
      from causes against which it is vain to struggle, poetry begins to
      decline. The progress of language, which was at first favourable, becomes
      fatal to it, and, instead of compensating for the decay of the
      imagination, accelerates that decay, and renders it more obvious. When the
      adventurer in the Arabian tale anointed one of his eyes with the contents
      of the magical box, all the riches of the earth, however widely dispersed,
      however sacredly concealed, became visible to him. But, when he tried the
      experiment on both eyes, he was struck with blindness. What the enchanted
      elixir was to the sight of the body, language is to the sight of the
      imagination. At first it calls up a world of glorious illusions; but, when
      it becomes too copious, it altogether destroys the visual power.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the development of the mind proceeds, symbols, instead of being
      employed to convey images, are substituted for them. Civilised men think
      as they trade, not in kind, but by means of a circulating medium. In these
      circumstances, the sciences improve rapidly, and criticism among the rest;
      but poetry, in the highest sense of the word, disappears. Then comes the
      dotage of the fine arts, a second childhood, as feeble as the former, and
      far more, hopeless. This is the age of <span class="pagenum">338</span><a
      name="link338" id="link338"></a>critical poetry, of poetry by courtesy, of
      poetry to which the memory, the judgment, and the wit contribute far more
      than the imagination. We readily allow that many works of this description
      are excellent: we will not contend with those who think them more valuable
      than the great poems of an earlier period. We only maintain that they
      belong to a different species of composition, and are produced by a
      different faculty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is some consolation to reflect that this critical school of poetry
      improves as the science of criticism improves; and that the science of
      criticism, like every other science, is constantly tending towards
      perfection. As experiments are multiplied, principles are better
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some countries, in our own, for example, there has been an interval
      between the downfall of the creative school and the rise of the critical,
      a period during which imagination has been in its decrepitude, and taste
      in its infancy. Such a revolutionary interregnum as this will be deformed
      by every species of extravagance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first victory of good taste is over the bombast and conceits which
      deform such times as these. But criticism is still in a very imperfect
      state. What is accidental is for a long time confounded with what is
      essential. General theories are drawn from detached facts. How many hours
      the action of a play may be allowed to occupy,&mdash;how many similes an
      Epic Poet may introduce into his first book,&mdash;whether a piece, which
      is acknowledged to have a beginning and an end, may not be without a
      middle, and other questions as puerile as these, formerly occupied the
      attention of men of letters in France, and even in this country. Poets, in
      such circumstances as these, exhibit all the <span class="pagenum">339</span><a
      name="link339" id="link339"></a>narrowness and feebleness of the criticism
      by which their manner has been fashioned. From outrageous absurdity they
      are preserved indeed by their timidity. But they perpetually sacrifice
      nature and reason to arbitrary canons of taste. In their eagerness to
      avoid the <i>mala prohibita</i> of a foolish code, they are perpetually
      rushing on the <i>mala in se</i>. Their great predecessors, it is true,
      were as bad critics as themselves, or perhaps worse: but those
      predecessors, as we have attempted to show, were inspired by a faculty
      independent of criticism, and, therefore, wrote well while they judged
      ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      In time men begin to take more rational and comprehensive views of
      literature. The analysis of poetry, which, as we have remarked, must at
      best be imperfect, approaches nearer and nearer to exactness. The merits
      of the wonderful models of former times are justly appreciated. The frigid
      productions of a later age are rated at no more than their proper value.
      Pleasing and ingenious imitations of the manner of the great masters
      appear. Poetry has a partial revival, a Saint Martin&rsquo;s Summer, which,
      after a period of dreariness and decay, agreeably reminds us of the
      splendour of its June. A second harvest is gathered in; though, growing on
      a spent soil, it has not the heart of the former. Thus, in the present
      age, Monti has successfully imitated the style of Dante; and something of
      the Elizabethan inspiration has been caught by several eminent countrymen
      of our own. But never will Italy produce another Inferno, or England
      another Hamlet. We look on the beauties of the modern imitations with
      feelings similar to those with which we see flowers disposed in vases, to
      ornament the drawing-rooms of a capital. We doubtless regard <span
      class="pagenum">340</span><a name="link340" id="link340"></a>them
      with pleasure, with greater pleasure, perhaps, because, in the midst of a
      place ungenial to them, they remind us of the distant spots on which they
      flourish in spontaneous exuberance. But we miss the sap, the freshness and
      the bloom. Or, if we may borrow another illustration from Queen
      Scheherezade, we would compare the writers of this school to the jewellers
      who were employed to complete the unfinished window of the palace of
      Aladdin. Whatever skill or-cost could do was done. Palace and bazaar were
      ransacked for precious stones. Yet the artists, with all their dexterity,
      with all their assiduity, and with all their vast means, were unable to
      produce anything comparable to the wonders which a spirit of a higher
      order had wrought in a single night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of every literature with which we are acquainted confirms, we
      think, the principles which we have laid down. In Greece we see the
      imaginative school of poetry gradually fading into the critical. Æschylus
      and Pindar were succeeded by Sophocles, Sophocles by Euripides, Euripides
      by the Alexandrian versifiers. Of these last, Theocritus alone has left
      compositions which deserve to be read. The splendour and grotesque
      fairyland of the Old Comedy, rich with such gorgeous hues, peopled with
      such fantastic shapes, and vocal alternately with the sweetest peals of
      music and the loudest bursts of elvish laughter, disappeared for ever. The
      master-pieces of the New Comedy are known to us by Latin translations of
      extraordinary merit. From these translations, and from the expressions of
      the ancient critics, it is clear that the original compositions were
      distinguished by grace and sweetness, that they sparkled with wit, and
      abounded with pleading sentiment; but that the creative power was <span
      class="pagenum">341</span><a name="link341" id="link341"></a>gone.
      Julius Cæsar called Terence a half Menander,&mdash;a sure proof that
      Menander was not a quarter Aristophanes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The literature of the Romans was merely a continuation of the literature
      of the Greeks. The pupils started from the point at which their masters
      had, in the course of many generations, arrived. They thus almost wholly
      missed the period of original invention. The only Latin poets whose
      writings exhibit much vigour of imagination are Lucretius and Catullus.
      The Augustan age produced nothing equal to their finer passages.
    </p>
    <p>
      In France, that licensed jester, whose jingling cap and motley coat
      concealed more genius than ever mustered in the saloon of Ninon or of
      Madame Géoffrin, was succeeded by writers as decorous and as tiresome as
      gentlemen-ushers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poetry of Italy and of Spain has undergone the same change. But
      nowhere has the revolution been more complete and violent than in England.
      The same person, who, when a boy, had clapped his thrilling hands at the
      first representation of the Tempest might, without attaining to a
      marvellous longevity, have lived to read the earlier works of Prior and
      Addison. The change, we believe, must, sooner or later, have taken place.
      But its progress was accelerated, and its character modified, by the
      political occurrences of the times, and particularly by two events, the
      closing of the theatres under the commonwealth, and the restoration of the
      House of Stuart.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have said that the critical and poetical faculties are not only
      distinct, but almost incompatible. The state of our literature during the
      reigns of Elizabeth and James the First is a strong confirmation of this
      <span class="pagenum">342</span><a name="link342" id="link342"></a>remark.
      The greatest works of imagination that the world has ever seen were
      produced at that period. The national taste, in the meantime, was to the
      last degree detestable. Alliterations, puns, antithetical forms of
      expression lavishly employed where no corresponding opposition existed
      between the thoughts expressed, strained allegories, pedantic allusions,
      everything, in short, quaint and affected, in matter and manner, made up
      what was then considered as fine writing. The eloquence of the bar, the
      pulpit, and the council-board, was deformed by conceits which would have
      disgraced the rhyming shepherds of an Italian academy. The king quibbled
      on the throne. We might, indeed, console ourselves by reflecting that his
      majesty was a fool. But the chancellor quibbled in concert from the
      wool-sack: and the chancellor was Francis Bacon. It is needless to mention
      Sidney and the whole tribe of Euphuists; for Shakspeare himself, the
      greatest poet that ever lived, falls into the same fault whenever he means
      to be particularly fine. While he abandons himself to the impulse of his
      imagination, his compositions are not only the sweetest and the most
      sublime, but also the most faultless, that the world has ever seen. But,
      as soon as his critical powers come into play, he sinks to the level of
      Cowley; or rather he does ill what Cowley did well. All that is bad in his
      works is bad elaborately, and of malice aforethought. The only thing
      wanting to make them perfect was, that he should never have troubled
      himself with thinking whether they were good or not. Like the angels in
      Milton, he sinks &ldquo;with compulsion and laborious flight.&rdquo; His natural
      tendency is upwards. That he may soar, it is only necessary that he should
      not struggle to fall. He resembles an American <span class="pagenum">343</span><a
      name="link343" id="link343"></a>Cacique, who, possessing in unmeasured
      abundance the metals which in polished societies are esteemed the most
      precious, was utterly unconscious of their value, and gave up treasures
      more valuable than the imperial crowns of other countries, to secure some
      gaudy and far-fetched but worthless bauble, a plated button, or a necklace
      of coloured glass.

      We have attempted to show that, as knowledge is extended and as the reason
      developes itself, the imitative arts decay. We should, therefore, expect
      that the corruption of poetry would commence in the educated classes of
      society. And this, in fact, is almost constantly the case. The few great
      works of imagination which appear in a critical age are, almost without
      exception, the works of uneducated men. Thus, at a time when persons of
      quality translated French romances, and when the universities celebrated
      royal deaths in verses about tritons and fauns, a preaching tinker
      produced the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress. And thus a ploughman startled a
      generation which had thought Hayley and Beattie great poets, with the
      adventures of Tam O&rsquo;Shanter. Even in the latter part of the reign of
      Elizabeth the fashionable poetry had degenerated. It retained few vestiges
      of the imagination of earlier times. It had not yet been subjected to the
      rules of good taste. Affectation had completely tainted madrigals and
      sonnets. The grotesque conceits and the tuneless numbers of Donne were, in
      the time of James, the favourite models of composition at Whitehall and at
      the Temple. But, though the literature of the Court was in its decay, the
      literature of the people was in its perfection. The Muses had taken
      sanctuary in the theatres, the haunts of a class whose taste was not
      better than that of the Right Honourables and <span class="pagenum">344</span><a
      name="link344" id="link344"></a>singular good Lords who admired
      metaphysical love-verses, but whose imagination retained all its freshness
      and vigour; whose censure and approbation might be erroneously bestowed,
      but whose tears and laughter were never in the wrong. The infection which
      had tainted lyric and didactic poetry had but slightly and partially
      touched the drama. While the noble and the learned were comparing eyes to
      burning-glasses, and tears to terrestrial globes, coyness to an enthymeme,
      absence to a pair of compasses, and an unrequited passion to the fortieth
      remainder-man in an entail, Juliet leaning from the balcony, and Miranda
      smiling over the chess-board, sent home many spectators, as kind and
      simple-hearted as the master and mistress of Fletcher&rsquo;s Ralpho, to cry
      themselves to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      No species of fiction is so delightful to us as the old English drama.
      Even its inferior productions possess a charm not to be found in any other
      kind of poetry. It is the most lucid mirror that ever was held up to
      nature. The creations of the great dramatists of Athens produce the effect
      of magnificent sculptures, conceived by a mighty imagination, polished
      with the utmost delicacy, embodying ideas of ineffable majesty and beauty,
      but cold, pale, and rigid, with no bloom on the check, and no speculation
      in the eye. In all the draperies, the figures, and the faces, in the
      lovers and the tyrants, the Bacchanals and the Furies, there is the same
      marble chillness and deadness. Most of the characters of the French stage
      resemble the waxen gentlemen and ladies in the window of a perfumer,
      rouged, curled, and bedizened, but fixed in such stiff attitudes, and
      staring with eyes expressive of such utter unmeaningness, that they cannot
      produce an illusion for a single moment. In the English plays alone is to
      <span class="pagenum">345</span><a name="link345" id="link345"></a>be
      found the warmth, the mellowness, and the reality of painting. We know the
      minds of the men and women, as we know the faces of the men and women of
      Vandyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excellence of these works is in a great measure the result of two
      peculiarities, which the critics of the French school consider as defects,&mdash;from
      the mixture of tragedy and comedy, and from the length and extent of the
      action. The former is necessary to render the drama a just representation
      of a world in which the laughers and the weepers are perpetually jostling
      each other,&mdash;in which every event has its serious and ludicrous side.
      The latter enables us to form an intimate acquaintance with characters
      with which we could not possibly become familiar during the few hours to
      which the unities restrict the poet. In this respect, the works of
      Shakspeare, in particular, are miracles of art. In a piece, which may be
      read aloud in three hours, we see a character gradually unfold all its
      recesses to us. We see it change with the change of circumstances. The
      petulant youth rises into the politic and warlike sovereign. The profuse
      and courteous philanthropist sours into a hater and scorn er of his kind.
      The tyrant is altered, by the chastening of affliction, into a pensive
      moralist. The veteran general, distinguished by coolness, sagacity, and
      self-command, sinks under a conflict between love strong as death, and
      jealousy cruel as the grave. The brave and loyal subject passes, step by
      step, to the extremities of human depravity. We trace his progress, from
      the first dawnings of unlawful ambition to the cynical melancholy of his
      impenitent remorse. Yet, in these pieces, there are no unnatural
      transitions. Nothing is omitted: nothing is crowded. Great as are the
      changes, narrow as is <span class="pagenum">346</span><a
      name="link346" id="link346"></a>the compass within which they are
      exhibited, they shock us as little as the gradual alterations of those
      familiar faces which we see every evening and every morning. The magical
      skill of the poet resembles that of the Dervise in the Spectator, who
      condensed all the events of seven years into the single moment during
      which the king held his head under the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is deserving of remark, that, at the time of which we speak, the plays
      even of men not eminently distinguished by genius,&mdash;such, for
      example, as Jonson,&mdash;were far superior to the best works of
      imagination in other departments. Therefore, though we conceive that, from
      causes which we have already investigated, our poetry must necessarily
      have declined, we think that, unless its fate had been accelerated by
      external attacks, it might have enjoyed an euthanasia, that genius might
      have been kept alive by the drama till its place could, in some degree, be
      supplied by taste,&mdash;that there would have been scarcely any interval
      between the age of sublime invention and that of agreeable imitation. The
      works of Shakspeare, which were not appreciated with any degree of justice
      before the middle of the eighteenth century, might then have been the
      recognized standards of excellence during the latter part of the
      seventeenth; and he and the great Elizabethan writers might have been
      almost immediately succeeded by a generation of poets similar to those who
      adorn our own times.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Puritans drove imagination from its last asylum. They prohibited
      theatrical representations, and stigmatised the whole race of dramatists
      as enemies of morality and religion. Much that is objectionable may be
      found in the writers whom they reprobated; but whether they took the best
      measures for stopping <span class="pagenum">347</span><a
      name="link347" id="link347"></a>the evil appears to us very doubtful, and
      must, we think, have appeared doubtful to themselves, when, after the
      lapse of a few years, they saw the unclean spirit whom they had cast out
      return to his old haunts, with seven others fouler than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the extinction of the drama, the fashionable school of poetry,&mdash;a
      school without truth of sentiment or harmony of versification,&mdash;without
      the powers of an earlier, or the correctness of a later age,&mdash;was
      left to enjoy undisputed ascendency. A vicious ingenuity, a morbid
      quickness to perceive resemblances and analogies between things apparently
      heterogeneous, constituted almost its only claim to admiration. Suckling
      was dead. Milton was absorbed in political and theological controversy. If
      Waller differed from the Cow-lei an sect of writers, he differed for the
      worse. He had as little poetry as they, and much less wit; nor is the
      languor of his verses less offensive than the ruggeedness of theirs. In
      Dedham alone the faint dawn of a better manner was discernible.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, low as was the state of our poetry during the civil war and the
      Protectorate, a still deeper fall was at hand. Hitherto our literature had
      been idiomatic. In mind as in situation we had been islanders. The
      revolutions in our taste, like the revolutions in our government, had been
      settled without the interference of strangers. Had this state of things
      continued, the same just principles of reasoning which, about this time,
      were applied with unprecedented success to every part of philosophy would
      soon have conducted our ancestors to a sounder code of criticism. There
      were already strong signs of improvement. Our prose had at length worked
      itself clear from those quaint conceits which still deformed almost every
      metrical composition. <span class="pagenum">348</span><a
      name="link348" id="link348"></a>The parliamentary debates, and the
      diplomatic correspondence of that eventful period, had contributed much to
      this reform. In such bustling times, it was absolutely necessary to speak
      and write to the purpose. The absurdities of Puritanism had, perhaps, done
      more. At the time when that odious style, which deforms the writings of
      Hall and of Lord Bacon, was almost universal, had appeared that stupendous
      work, the English Bible,&mdash;a book which, if everything else in our
      language should perish, would alone suffice to show the whole extent of
      its beauty and power. The respect which the translators felt for the
      original prevented them from adding any of the hideous decorations then in
      fashion. The ground-work of the version, indeed, was of an earlier age.
      The familiarity with which the Puritans, on almost every occasion, used
      the Scriptural phrases was no doubt very ridiculous; but it produced good
      effects. It was a cant; but it drove out a cant far more offensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highest kind of poetry is, in a great measure, independent of those
      circumstances which regulate the style of composition in prose. But with
      that inferior species of poetry which succeeds to it the case is widely
      different. In a few years, the good sense and good taste which had weeded
      out affectation from moral and political treatises would, in the natural
      course of things, have effected a similar reform in the sonnet and the
      ode. The rigour of the victorious sectaries had relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dominant religion is never ascetic. The Government connived at
      theatrical representations. The influence of Shakspeare was once more
      felt. But darker days were approaching. A foreign yoke was to be imposed
      on our literature. Charles, surrounded by the companions of his long
      exile, returned to govern <span class="pagenum">349</span><a
      name="link349" id="link349"></a>a nation which ought never to have cast
      him out or never to have received him back. Every year which he had passed
      among strangers had rendered him more unfit to rule his countrymen. In
      France he had seen the refractory magistracy humbled, and royal
      prerogative, though exercised by a foreign priest in the name of a child,
      victorious over all opposition. This spectacle naturally gratified a
      prince to whose family the opposition of Parliaments had been so fatal.
      Politeness was his solitary good quality. The insults which he had
      suffered in Scotland had taught him to prize it. The effeminacy and apathy
      of his disposition fitted him to excel in it. The elegance and vivacity of
      the French manners fascinated him. With the political maxims and the
      social habits of his favourite people, he adopted their taste in
      composition, and, when seated on the throne, soon rendered it fashionable,
      partly by direct patronage, but still more by that contemptible policy
      which, for a time, made England the last of the nations, and raised Louis
      the Fourteenth to a height of power and fame, such as no French sovereign
      had ever before attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to please Charles that rhyme was first introduced into our plays.
      Thus, a rising blow, which would at any time have been mortal, was dealt
      to the English Drama, then just recovering from its languishing condition.
      Two detestable manners, the indigenous and the imported, were now in a
      state of alternate conflict and amalgamation. The bombastic meanness of
      the new style was blended with the ingenious absurdity of the old; and the
      mixture produced something which the world had never before seen, and
      which, we hope, it will never see again,&mdash;something, by the side of
      which the worst nonsense of all other ages <span class="pagenum">350</span><a
      name="link350" id="link350"></a>appears to advantage,&mdash;something,
      which those who have attempted to caricature it have, against their will,
      been forced to flatter,&mdash;of which the tragedy of Bayes is a very
      favourable specimen. What Lord Dorset observed to Edward Howard might have
      been addressed to almost all his contemporaries:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;As skilful divers to the bottom fall </span><br />
      <span class="indent15">Swifter than those who cannot swim at all; </span><br />
      <span class="indent15">So, in this way of writing without thinking,
      </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Thou hast a strange alacrity in
      sinking.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      From this reproach some clever men of the world must be excepted, and
      among them Dorset himself. Though by no means great poets, or even good
      versifiers, they always wrote with meaning, and sometimes with wit.
      Nothing indeed more strongly shows to what a miserable state literature
      had fallen, than the immense superiority which the occasional rhymes,
      carelessly thrown on paper by men of this class, possess over the
      elaborate productions of almost all the professed authors. The reigning
      taste was so bad, that the success of a writer was in inverse proportion
      to his labour, and to his desire of excellence. An exception must be made
      for Butler, who had as much wit and learning as Cowley, and who knew, what
      Cowley never knew, how to use them. A great command of good homely English
      distinguishes him still more from the other writers of the time. As for
      Gondibert, those may criticise it who can read it. Imagination was
      extinct. Taste was depraved. Poetry, driven from palaces, colleges, and
      theatres, had found an asylum in the obscure dwelling where a Great Man,
      born out of due season, in disgrace, penury, pain, and blindness, still
      kept uncontaminated a character and a genius worthy of a better age. <span
      class="pagenum">351</span><a name="link351" id="link351"></a>Everything
      about Milton is wonderful; but nothing is so wonderful as that, in an age
      so unfavourable to poetry, he should have produced the greatest of modern
      epic poems. We are not sure that this is not in some degree to be
      attributed to his want of sight. The imagination is notoriously most
      active when the external world is shut out. In sleep its illusions are
      perfect. They produce all the effect of realities. In darkness its visions
      are always more distinct than in the light. Every person who amuses
      himself with what is called building castles in the air must have
      experienced this. We know artists who, before they attempt to draw a face
      from memory, close their eyes, that they may recall a more perfect image
      of the features and the expression. We are therefore inclined to believe
      that the genius of Milton may have been preserved from the influence of
      times so unfavourable to it by his infirmity. Be this as it may, his works
      at first enjoyed a very small share of popularity. To be neglected by his
      contemporaries was the penalty which he paid for surpassing them. His
      great poem was not generally studied or admired till writers far inferior
      to him had, by obsequiously cringing to the public taste, acquired
      sufficient favour to reform it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these, Dryden was the most eminent. Amidst the crowd of authors who,
      during the earlier years of Charles the Second, courted notoriety by every
      species of absurdity and affectation, he speedily became conspicuous. No
      man exercised so much influence on the age. The reason is obvious. On no
      man did the age exercise so much influence. He was perhaps the greatest of
      those whom we have designated as the critical poets; and his literary
      career exhibited, on a reduced scale, the whole history of the school to
      which <span class="pagenum">352</span><a name="link352" id="link352"></a>he
      belonged,&mdash;the rudeness and extravagance of its infancy,&mdash;the
      propriety, the grace, the dignified good sense, the temperate splendour of
      its maturity. His imagination was torpid, till it was awakened by his
      judgment. He began with quaint parallels and empty mouthing. He gradually
      acquired the energy of the satirist, the gravity of the moralist, the
      rapture of the lyric poet. The revolution through which English literature
      has been passing, from the time of Cowley to that of Scott, may be seen in
      miniature within the compass of his volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His life divides itself into two parts. There is some debatable ground on
      the common frontier; but the line may be drawn with tolerable accuracy.
      The year 1678 is that on which we should be inclined to fix as the date of
      a great change in his manner. During the preceding period appeared some of
      his courtly panegyrics,&mdash;his Annus Mirabilis, and most of his plays;
      indeed, all his rhyming tragedies. To the subsequent period belong his
      best dramas,&mdash;All for Love, The Spanish Friar, and Sebastian,&mdash;his
      satires, his translations, his didactic poems, his fables, and his odes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the small pieces which were presented to chancellors and princes it
      would scarcely be fair to speak. The greatest advantage which the Fine
      Arts derive from the extension of knowledge is, that the patronage of
      individuals becomes unnecessary. Some writers still affect to regret the
      age of patronage. None but bad writers have reason to regret it. It is
      always an age of general ignorance. Where ten thousand readers are eager
      for the appearance of a book, a small contribution from each makes up a
      splendid remuneration for the author. Where literature is a luxury,
      confined to few, each of them must pay high. If the Empress <span
      class="pagenum">353</span><a name="link353" id="link353"></a>Catherine,
      for example, wanted an epic poem, she must have wholly supported the poet;&mdash;just
      as, in a remote country village, a man who wants a mutton-chop is
      sometimes forced to take the whole sheep;&mdash;a thing which never
      happens where the demand is large. But men who pay largely for the
      gratification of their taste will expect to have it united with some
      gratification to their vanity. Flattery is carried to a shameless extent;
      and the habit of flattery almost inevitably introduces a false taste into
      composition. Its language is made up of hyperbolical common-places,&mdash;offensive
      from their triteness,&mdash;still more offensive from their extravagance.
      In no school is the trick of overstepping the modesty of nature so
      speedily acquired. The writer, accustomed to find exaggeration acceptable
      and necessary on one subject, uses it on all. It is not strange,
      therefore, that the early panegyrical verses of Dryden should be made up
      of meanness and bombast. They abound with the conceits which his immediate
      predecessors had brought into fashion. But his language and his
      versification were already far superior to their&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Annus Mirabilis shows great command of expression, and a fine ear for
      heroic rhyme. Here its merits end. Not only has it no claim to be called
      poetry, but it seems to be the work of a man who could never, by any
      possibility, write poetry. Its affected similes are the best part of it.
      Gaudy weeds present a more encouraging spectacle than utter barrenness.
      There is scarcely a single stanza in this long work to which the
      imagination seems to have contributed anything. It is produced, not by
      creation, but by construction. It is made up, not of pictures, but of
      inferences. We will give a single instance, and <span class="pagenum">354</span><a
      name="link354" id="link354"></a>certainly a favourable instance,&mdash;a
      quatrain which Johnson has praised. Dryden is describing the sea-fight
      with the Dutch.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;Amidst whole heaps of spices lights a ball;
      </span><br /> <span class="indent15">And now their odours armed against
      them fly. </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Some preciously by shattered
      porcelain fall. </span><br /> <span class="indent15">And some by aromatic
      splinters die.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The poet should place his readers, as nearly as possible, in the situation
      of the sufferers or the spectators. His narration ought to produce
      feelings similar to those which would be excited by the event itself. Is
      this the case here? Who, in a sea-fight, ever thought of the price of the
      china which beats out the brains of a sailor; or of the odour of the
      splinter which shatters his leg? It is not by an act of the imagination,
      at once calling up the scene before the interior eye, but by painful
      meditation,&mdash;by turning the subject round and round,&mdash;by tracing
      out facts into remote consequences,&mdash;that these incongruous topics
      are introduced into the description. Homer, it is true, perpetually uses
      epithets which are not peculiarly appropriate. Achilles is
      the-swift-footed, when he is sitting still. Ulysses is the much-enduring,
      when he has nothing to endure. Every spear casts a long shadow, every ox
      has crooked horns, and every woman a high bosom, though these particulars
      may be quite beside the purpose. In our old ballads a similar practice
      prevails. The gold is always red, and the ladies always gay, though
      nothing whatever may depend on the hue of the gold, or the temper of the
      ladies. But these adjectives are mere customary additions. They merge in
      the substantives to which they are attached. If they at all colour the
      idea, it is with a tinge so slight as in no respect to alter the general
      effect. In the <span class="pagenum">355</span><a name="link355"
       id="link355"></a>passage which we have quoted from Dryden the case is very
      different..<i>Preciously</i> and <i>aromatic</i> divert our whole
      attention to themselves, and dissolve the image of the battle in a moment.
      The whole poem reminds us of Lucan, and of the worst parts of Lucan,&mdash;the
      sea-fight in the Bay of Marseilles, for example. The description of the
      two fleets during the night is perhaps the only passage which ought to be
      exempted from this censure. If it was from the Annus Mirabilis that Milton
      formed his opinion, when he pronounced Dryden a good rhymer but no poet,
      he certainly judged correctly. But Dryden was, as we have said, one of
      those writers in whom the period of imagination does not precede, but
      follow, the period of observation and reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      His plays, his rhyming plays in particular, are admirable subjects for
      those who wish to study the morbid anatomy of the drama. He was utterly
      destitute of the power of exhibiting real human beings. Even in the far
      inferior talent of composing characters out of those elements into which
      the imperfect process of our reason can resolve them, he was very
      deficient. His men are not even good personifications; they are not
      well-assorted assemblages of qualities. Now and then, indeed, he seizes a
      very coarse and marked distinction, and gives us, not a likeness, but a
      strong caricature, in which a single peculiarity is protruded, and
      everything else neglected; like the Marquis of Granby at an inn-door, whom
      we know by nothing but his baldness; or Wilkes, who is Wilkes only in his
      squint. These are the best specimens of his skill. For most of his
      pictures seem, like Turkey carpets, to have been expressly designed not to
      resemble anything in the heavens above, in the earth beneath, or in the
      waters under the earth. <span class="pagenum">356</span><a
      name="link356" id="link356"></a>The latter manner he practises most
      frequently in his tragedies, the former in his comedies. The comic
      characters are, without mixture, loathsome and despicable. The men of
      Etherege and Vanbrugh are bad enough. Those of Smollett are perhaps worse.
      But they do not approach to the Celadons, the Wildbloods, the Woodalls,
      and the Rhodophils of Dryden. The vices of these last are set off by a
      certain fierce hard impudence, to which we know nothing comparable. Their
      love is the appetite of beasts; their friendship the confederacy of
      knaves. The ladies seem to have been expressly created to form helps meet
      for such gentlemen. In deceiving and insulting their old fathers they do
      not perhaps exceed the license which, by im memorial prescription, has
      been allowed to heroines. But they also cheat at cards, rob strong boxes,
      put up their favours to auction, betray their friends, abuse their rivals
      in the style of Billingsgate, and invite their lovers in the language of
      the Piazza. These, it must be remembered, are not the valets and
      waiting-women, the Mascarilles and Nerines, but the recognised heroes and
      heroines, who appear as the representatives of good society, and who, at
      the end of the fifth act, marry and live very happily ever after. The
      sensuality, baseness, and malice of their natures is unredeemed by any
      quality of a different description,&mdash;by any touch of kindness,&mdash;or
      even by any honest burst of hearty hatred and revenge. We are in a world
      where there is no humanity, no veracity, no sense of shame,&mdash;a world
      for which any good-natured man would gladly take in exchange the society
      of Milton&rsquo;s devils. But, as soon as we enter the regions of Tragedy, we
      find a great change. There is no lack of fine sentiment there. Metastasio
      is surpassed <span class="pagenum">357</span><a name="link357"
       id="link357"></a>in his own department. Scuderi is out-scuderied. We are
      introduced to people whose proceedings we can trace to no motive,&mdash;of
      whose feelings we can form no more idea than of a sixth sense. We have
      left a race of creatures, whose love is as delicate and affectionate as
      the passion which an alderman feels for a turtle. We find ourselves among
      being&rsquo;s, whose love is a purely disinterested emotion,&mdash;a loyalty
      extending to passive obedience,&mdash;a religion, like that of the
      Quietists, unsupported by any sanction of hope or fear. We see nothing but
      despotism without power, and sacrifices without compensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will give a few instances. In Aurengzebe, Arimant, governor of Agra,
      falls in love with his prisoner Indamora. She rejects his suit with scorn;
      but assures him that she shall make great use of her power over him. He
      threatens to be angry. She answers, very coolly:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;Do not: your anger, like your love, is vain:
      </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Whene&rsquo;er I please, you must be pleased
      again. </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Knowing what power I have your
      will to bend, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">I&rsquo;ll use it; for I need
      just such a friend.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This is no idle menace. She soon brings a letter addressed to his rival,&mdash;orders
      him to read it,&mdash;asks him whether he thinks it sufficiently tender,&mdash;and
      finally commands him to carry it himself. Such tyranny as this, it may be
      thought, would justify resistance. Arimant does indeed venture to
      remonstrate:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent20">&ldquo;This fatal paper rather let me tear, </span><br />
      <span class="indent20">Than, like Bellerophon, my sentence bear.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer of the lady is incomparable:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent20">&ldquo;You may; but &rsquo;twill not be your best
      advice; </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Twill only give me pains of
      writing twice. </span><br /> <span class="indent20">You know you must obey
      me, soon or late. </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Why should you
      vainly struggle with your fate?&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">358</span><a name="link358" id="link358"></a>Poor
      Arimant seems to be of the same opinion. He mutters something about fate
      and free-will, and walks off with the billet-doux.

      In the Indian Emperor, Montezuma presents Alméria with a garland as a
      token of his love, and offers to make her his queen. She replies:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;I take this garland, not as given by you;
      </span><br /> <span class="indent15">But as my merit&rsquo;s and my beauty&rsquo;s due;
      </span><br /> <span class="indent15">As for the crown which you, my slave,
      possess, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">To share it with you would
      but make me less.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In return for such proofs of tenderness as these, her admirer consents to
      murder his two sons and a benefactor to whom he feels the warmest
      gratitude. Lyndaraxa, in the Conquest of Granada, assumes the same lofty
      tone with Abdelmelech. He complains that she smiles upon his rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;Lynd. And when did I my power so far resign,
      </span><br /> <span class="indent20">That you should regulate each look of
      mine? </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Abdel. Then, when you gave your
      love, you gave that power. </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Lynd.&rsquo;Twas
      during pleasure&mdash; &rsquo;tis revoked this hour. </span><br /> <span
      class="indent15">Abdel. I&rsquo;ll hate you, and this visit is my last. </span><br />

      That these passages violate all historical propriety, that sentiments to
      which nothing similar was ever even affected except by the cavaliers of
      Europe, are transferred to Mexico and Agra, is a light accusation. We have
      no objection to a conventional world, an Illyrian puritan, or a Bohemian
      sea-port. While the faces are good, we care little about the back-ground.
      Sir Joshua Reynolds says that the curtains and hangings in a historical
      painting ought to be, not velvet or cotton, but merely drapery. The same
      principle should be applied to poetry and romance. The truth of character
      is the first object; the truth of place and time is to be considered only
      in the second place. Puff himself could tell the actor to turn out his
      toes, and remind him that <span class="pagenum">359</span><a
      name="link359" id="link359"></a>Keeper Hatton was a great dancer. We wish
      that, in our own time, a writer of a very different order from Puff had
      not too often forgotten human nature in the niceties of upholstery,
      millinery, and cookery.
    </p>
    <p>
      We blame Dryden, not because the persons of his dramas are not Moors or
      Americans, but because they are not men and women;&mdash;not because love,
      such as he represents it, could not exist in a harem or in a wigwam, but
      because it could not exist anywhere. As is the love of his heroes, such
      are all their other emotions. All their qualities, their courage, their
      generosity, their pride, are on the same colossal scale. Justice and
      prudence are virtues which can exist only in a moderate degree, and which
      change their nature and their name if pushed to excess. Of justice and
      prudence, therefore, Dryden leaves his favourites destitute. He did not
      care to give them what he could not give without measure. The tyrants and
      ruffians are merely the heroes altered by a few touches, similar to those
      which transformed the honest face of Sir Roger de Coverley into the
      Saracen&rsquo;s head. Through the grin and frown the original features are still
      perceptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in the tragi-comedies that these absurdities strike us most. The two
      races of men, or rather the angels and the baboons, are there presented to
      us together. We meet in one scene with nothing but gross, selfish,
      unblushing, lying libertines of both sexes, who, as a punishment, we
      suppose, for their depravity, are condemned to talk nothing but prose.
      But, as soon as we meet with people who speak in verse, we know that we
      are in society which would have enraptured the Cathos and Madelon of
      Moliere, in society for which Croondates would have too little of the
      lover, and Clelia too much of the coquette. <span class="pagenum">360</span><a
      name="link360" id="link360"></a>As Dryden was unable to render his plays
      interesting by means of that which is the peculiar and appropriate
      excellence of the drama, it was necessary that he should find some
      substitute for it. In his comedies he supplied its place, sometimes by
      wit, but more frequently by intrigue, by disguises, mistakes of persons,
      dialogues at cross purposes, hair-breadth escapes, perplexing
      concealments, and surprising disclosures. He thus succeeded at least in
      making these pieces very amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his tragedies he trusted, and not altogether without reason, to his
      diction and his versification. It was on this account, in all probability,
      that he so eagerly adopted, and so reluctantly abandoned, the practice of
      rhyming in his plays. What is unnatural appears less unnatural in that
      species of verse than in fines which approach more nearly to common
      conversation; and in the management of the heroic couplet Dryden has never
      been equalled. It is unnecessary to urge any arguments against a fashion
      now universally condemned. But it is worthy of observation, that, though
      Dryden was deficient in that talent which blank verse exhibits to the
      greatest advantage, and was certainly the best writer of heroic rhyme in
      our language, yet the plays which have, from the time of their first
      appearance, been considered as his best, are in blank verse. No experiment
      can be more decisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be allowed that the worst even of the rhyming tragedies contains
      good description and magnificent rhetoric. But, even when we forget that
      they are plays, and, passing by their dramatic improprieties, consider
      them with reference to the language, we are perpetually disgusted by
      passages which it is difficult to conceive how any author could have
      written, or any <span class="pagenum">361</span><a name="link361"
       id="link361"></a>audience have tolerated, rants in which the raving
      violence of the manner forms a strange contrast with the abject tameness
      of the thought. The author laid the whole fault on the audience, and
      declared that, when he wrote them, he considered them bad enough to
      please. This defence is unworthy of a man of genius, and, after all, is no
      defence. Otway pleased without rant; and so might Dryden have done, if he
      had possessed the powers of Otway. The fact is, that he had a tendency to
      bombast, which, though subsequently corrected by time and thought, was
      never wholly removed, and which showed itself in performances not designed
      to please the rude mob of the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some indulgent critics have represented this failing as an indication of
      genius, as the profusion of unlimited wealth, the wantonness of exuberant
      vigour. To us it seems to bear a nearer affinity to the tawdriness of
      poverty, or the spasms and convulsions of weakness. Dryden surely had not
      more imagination than Homer, Dante, or Milton, who never fall into this
      vice. The swelling diction of Æschylus and Isaiah resembles that of
      Almanzor and Maximin no more than the tumidity of a muscle resembles the
      tumidity of a boil. The former is symptomatic of health and strength, the
      latter of debility and disease. If ever Shakspeare rants, it is not when
      his imagination is hurrying him along, but when he is hurrying his
      imagination along,&mdash;when his mind is for a moment jaded,&mdash;when,
      as was said of Euripides, he resembles a lion, who excites his own fury by
      lashing himself with his tail. What happened to Shakspeare from the
      occasional suspension of his powers happened to Dryden from constant
      impotence. He, like his confederate Lee, had judgment enough to appreciate
      the great poets of the preceding age, but not <span class="pagenum">362</span><a
      name="link362" id="link362"></a>judgment enough to shun competition with
      them. He felt and admired their wild and daring sublimity. That it
      belonged to another age than that in which he lived and required other
      talents than those which he possessed, that, in aspiring to emulate it, he
      was wasting, in a hopeless attempt, powers which might render him
      pre-eminent in a different career, was a lesson which he did not learn
      till late. As those knavish enthusiasts, the French prophets, courted
      inspiration by mimicking the writhings, swoonings, and gaspings which they
      considered as its symptoms, he attempted, by affected fits of poetical
      fury, to bring on a real paroxysm; and, like them, he got nothing but his
      distortions for his pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace very happily compares those who, in his time, imitated Pindar to
      the youth who attempted to fly to heaven on waxen wings, and who
      experienced so fatal and ignominious a fall. His own admirable good sense
      preserved him from this error, and taught him to cultivate a style in
      which excellence was within his reach. Dryden had not the same
      self-knowledge. He saw that the greatest poets were never so successful as
      when they rushed beyond the ordinary bounds, and that some inexplicable
      good fortune preserved them from tripping even when they staggered on the
      brink of nonsense. He did not perceive that they were guided and sustained
      by a power denied to himself. They wrote from the dictation of the
      imagination; and they found a response in the imaginations of others. He,
      on the contrary, sat down to work himself, by reflection and argument,
      into a deliberate wildness, a rational frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In looking over the admirable designs which accompany the Faust, we have
      always been much struck by <span class="pagenum">363</span><a
      name="link363" id="link363"></a>one which represents the wizard and the
      tempter riding at full speed. The demon sits on his furious horse as
      heedlessly as if he were reposing on a chair. That he should keep his
      saddle in such a posture, would seem impossible to any who did not know
      that he was secure in the privileges of a superhuman nature. The attitude
      of Faust, on the contrary, is the perfection of horsemanship. Poets of the
      first order might safely write as desperately as Mephistophiles rode. But
      Dryden, though admitted to communion with higher spirits, though armed
      with a portion of their power, and intrusted with some of their secrets,
      was of another race. What they might securely venture to do, it was
      madness in him to attempt. It was necessary that taste and critical
      science should supply his deficiencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will give a few examples. Nothing can be finer than the description of
      Hector at the Grecian wall:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

      <a href="images/0411.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      What daring expressions! Yet how significant! How picturesque! Hector
      seems to rise up in his strength and fury. The gloom of night in his
      frown,&mdash;the fire burning in his eyes,&mdash;the javelins and the
      blazing armour,&mdash;the mighty rush through the gates and down the
      battlements,&mdash;the trampling and the infinite roar of the multitude,&mdash;everything
      is with us; everything is real. <span class="pagenum">364</span><a
      name="link364" id="link364"></a>Dryden has described a very similar event
      in Maximin, and has done his best to he sublime, as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;There with a forest of their darts he
      strove, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">And stood like Capaneus
      defying Jove; </span><br /> <span class="indent15">With his broad sword the
      boldest beating down, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Till Fate grew
      pale, lest he should win the town, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">And
      turned the iron leaves of its dark book </span><br /> <span class="indent15">To
      make new dooms, or mend what it mistook.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      How exquisite is the imagery of the fairy songs in the Tempest and in the
      Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream; Ariel riding through the twilight on the bat, or
      sucking in the bells of flowers with the bee; or the little bower-women of
      Titania, driving the spiders from the couch of the Queen! Dryden truly
      said, that
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;Shakspeare&rsquo;s magic could not copied be:
      </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Within that circle none durst walk but
      he.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been well if he had not himself dared to step within the
      enchanted line, and drawn on himself a fate similar to that which,
      according to the old superstition, punished such presumptuous
      interference. The following lines are parts of the song of his fairies:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;Merry, merry, merry, we sail from the East,
      </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Half-tippled at a rainbow feast.
      </span><br /> <span class="indent15">In the bright moonshine, while winds
      whistle loud, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">Tivv, tivy, tivy, we
      mount and we fly, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">All racking along in
      a downy white cloud; </span><br /> <span class="indent15">And lest our leap
      from the sky prove too far, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">We slide
      on the back of a new falling star, </span><br /> <span class="indent15">And
      drop from above </span><br /> <span class="indent15">In a jelly of love.&rdquo;
       </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      These are very favourable instances. Those who wish for a bad one may read
      the dying speeches of Maximin, and may compare them with the last scenes
      of Othello and Lear.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Dryden had died before the expiration of the first of the periods into
      which we have divided his literary <span class="pagenum">365</span><a
      name="link365" id="link365"></a>life, he would have left a reputation, at
      best, little higher than that of Lee or Davenant. He would have been known
      only to men of letters; and by them he would have been mentioned as a
      writer who threw away, on subjects which he was incompetent to treat,
      powers which, judiciously employed, might have raised him to eminence;
      whose diction and whose numbers had sometimes very high merit; but all
      whose works were blemished by a false taste, and by errors of gross
      negligence. A few of his prologues and epilogues might perhaps still have
      been remembered and quoted. In these little pieces he early showed all the
      powers which afterwards rendered him the greatest of modern satirists.
      But, during the latter part of his life, he gradually abandoned the drama.
      His plays appeared at longer intervals. He renounced rhyme in tragedy. His
      language became less turgid&mdash;his characters less exaggerated. He did
      not indeed produce correct representations of human nature; but he ceased
      to daub such monstrous chimeras as those which abound in his earlier
      pieces. Here and there passages occur worthy of the best ages of the
      British stage. The style which the drama requires changes with every
      change of character and situation. He who can vary his manner to suit the
      variation is the great dramatist; but he who excels in one manner only
      will, when that manner happens to be appropriate, appear to be a great
      dramatist; as the hands of a watch which does not go point right once in
      the twelve hours. Sometimes there is a scene of solemn debate. This a mere
      rhetorician may write as well as the greatest tragedian that ever lived.
      We confess that to us the speech of Sempronius in Cato seems very nearly
      as good as Shakspeare could have made it. But when the senate breaks up,
      and <span class="pagenum">366</span><a name="link366" id="link366"></a>we
      find that the lovers and their mistresses, the hero, the villain, and the
      deputy-villain, all continue to harangue in the same style, we perceive
      the difference between a man who can write a play and a man who can write
      a speech. In the same manner, wit, a talent for description, or a talent
      for narration, may, for a time, pass for dramatic genius. Dryden was an
      incomparable reasoned in verse. He was conscious of his power; he was
      proud of it; and the authors of the Rehearsal justly charged him with
      abusing it. His warriors and princesses are fond of discussing points of
      amorous casuistry, such as would have delighted a Parliament of Love. They
      frequently go still deeper, and speculate on philosophical necessity and
      the origin of evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were, however, some occasions which absolutely required this
      peculiar talent. Then Dryden was indeed at home. All his best scenes are
      of this description. They are all between men; for the heroes of Dryden,
      like many other gentlemen, can never talk sense when ladies are in
      company. They are all intended to exhibit the empire of reason over
      violent passion. We have two interlocutors, the one eager and impassioned,
      the other high, cool, and judicious. The composed and rational character
      gradually acquires the ascendency. His fierce companion is first inflamed
      to rage by his reproaches, then overawed by his equanimity, convinced by
      his arguments, and soothed by his persuasions. This is the case in the
      scene between Hector and Troilus, in that between Antony and Ventidius,
      and in that between Sebastian and Dorax. Nothing of the same kind in
      Shakspeare is equal to them, except the quarrel between Brutus and
      Cassius, which is worth them all three. <span class="pagenum">367</span><a
      name="link367" id="link367"></a>Some years before his death, Dryden
      altogether ceased to write for the stage. He had turned his powers in a
      new direction, with success the most splendid and decisive. His taste had
      gradually awakened his creative faculties. The first rank in poetry was
      beyond his reach; but he challenged and secured the most honorable place
      in the second. His imagination resembled the wings of an ostrich. It
      enabled him to run, though not to soar. When he attempted the highest
      flights, he became ridiculous; but, while he remained in a lower region,
      he outstripped all competitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      All his natural and all his acquired powers fitted him to found a good
      critical school of poetry. Indeed he carried his reforms too far for his
      age. After his death, our literature retrograded: and a century was
      necessary to bring it back to the point at which he left it. The general
      soundness and healthfulness of his mental constitution, his information of
      vast superficies though of small volume, his wit scarcely inferior to that
      of the most distinguished followers of Donne, his eloquence, grave,
      deliberate, and commanding, could not save him from disgraceful failure as
      a rival of Shakspeare, but raised him far above the level of Boileau. His
      command of language was immense. With him died the secret of the old
      poetical diction of England,&mdash;the art of producing rich effects by
      familiar words. In the following century, it was as completely lost as the
      Gothic method of painting glass, and was but poorly supplied by the
      laborious and tesselated imitations of Mason and Gray. On the other hand,
      he was the first writer under whose skilful management the scientific
      vocabulary fell into natural and pleasing verse. In this department, he
      succeeded as completely as his contemporary Gibbons succeeded in the
      similar <span class="pagenum">368</span><a name="link368" id="link368"></a>enterprise
      of carving the most delicate flowers from heart of oak. The toughest and
      most knotty parts of language became ductile at his touch. His
      versification in the same manner, while it gave the first model of that
      neatness and precision which the following generation esteemed so highly,
      exhibited, at the same time, the last examples of nobleness, freedom,
      variety of pause, and cadence. His tragedies in rhyme, however worthless
      in themselves, had at least served the purpose of nonsense-verses; they
      had taught him all the arts of melody which the heroic couplet admits. For
      bombast, his prevailing vice, his new subjects gave little opportunity;
      his better taste gradually discarded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He possessed, as we have said, in a pre-eminent degree, the power of
      reasoning in verse; and this power was now peculiarly useful to him. His
      logic is by no means uniformly sound. On points of criticism, he always
      reasons ingeniously; and, when he is disposed to be honest, correctly. But
      the theological and political questions which he undertook to treat in
      verse were precisely those which he understood least. His arguments,
      therefore, are often worthless. But the manner in which they are stated is
      beyond all praise. The style is transparent. The topics follow each other
      in the happiest order. The objections are drawn up in such a manner that
      the whole fire of the reply may be brought to bear on them. The
      circumlocutions which are substituted for technical phrases are clear,
      neat, and exact. The illustrations at once adorn and elucidate the
      reasoning. The sparkling epigrams of Cowley, and the simple garrulity of
      the buidesque poets of Italy, are alternately employed, in the happiest
      manner, to give effect to what is obvious, or clearness to what is
      obscure. <span class="pagenum">369</span><a name="link369"
       id="link369"></a>His literary creed was catholic, even to
      latitudinarianism; not from any want of acuteness, but from a disposition
      to be easily satisfied. He was quick to discern the smallest glimpse of
      merit; he was indulgent even to gross improprieties, when accompanied by
      any redeeming talent. When he said a severe thing, it was to serve a
      temporary purpose,&mdash;to support an argument, or to tease a rival.
      Never was so able a critic so free from fastidiousness. He loved the old
      poets, especially Shakspeare. He admired the ingenuity which Donne and
      Cowley had so wildly abused. He did justice, amidst the general silence,
      to the memory of Milton. He praised to the skies the school-boy lines of
      Addison. Always looking on the fair side of every object, he admired
      extravagance on account of the invention which he supposed it to indicate;
      he excused affectation in favour of wit; he tolerated even tameness for
      the sake of the correctness which was its concomitant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was probably to this turn of mind, rather than to the more disgraceful
      causes which Johnson has assigned, that we are to attribute the
      exaggeration which dis-&rsquo;figures the panegyrics of Dryden. No writer, it
      must be owned, has carried the flattery of dedication to a greater length.
      But this was not, we suspect, merely interested servility: it was the
      overflowing of a mind singularly disposed to admiration,&mdash;of a mind
      which diminished vices, and magnified virtues and obligations. The most
      adulatory of his addresses is that in which he dedicates the State of
      Innocence to Mary of Modena. Johnson thinks it strange that any man should
      use such language without self-detestation. But he has not remarked that
      to the very same work is prefixed an eulogium on Milton, which certainly
      could not have <span class="pagenum">370</span><a name="link370"
       id="link370"></a>been acceptable at the court of Charles the Second. Many
      years later, when Whig principles were in a great measure triumphant,
      Sprat refused to admit a monument of John Philips into Westminster Abbey&mdash;because,
      in the epitaph, the name of Milton incidently occurred. The walls of his
      church, he declared, should not be polluted by the name of a republican!
      Dryden was attached, both by principle and interest, to the Court. But
      nothing could deaden his sensibility to excellence. We are unwilling to
      accuse him severely, because the same disposition, which prompted him to
      pay so generous a tribute to the memory of a poet whom his patrons
      detested, hurried him into extravagance when he described a princess
      distinguished by the splendour of her beauty and the graciousness of her
      manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an amiable temper; but it is not the temper of great men. Where
      there is elevation of character, there will be fastidiousness. It is only
      in novels and on tombstones that we meet with people who are indulgent to
      the faults of others, and unmerciful to their own; and Dry den, at all
      events, was not one of these paragons. His charity was extended most
      liberally to » others; but it certainly began at home. In taste he was by
      no means deficient. His critical work! are, beyond all comparison,
      superior to any which had, till then, appeared in England. They were
      generally intended as apologies for his own poems, rather than as
      expositions of general principles; he, therefore, often attempts to
      deceive the reader by sophistry which could scarcely have deceived
      himself. His dicta are the dicta, not of a judge, but of an advocate;&mdash;often
      of an advocate in an unsound cause. Yet, in the very act of
      misrepresenting the laws of composition, he shows how <span class="pagenum">371</span><a
      name="link371" id="link371"></a>well he understands them. But he was
      perpetually acting against his better knowledge. His sins were sins
      against light. He trusted that what was bad would be pardoned for the sake
      of what was good. What was good, he took no pains to make better. He was
      not, like most persons who rise to eminence, dissatisfied even with his
      best productions. He had set up no unattainable standard of perfection,
      the contemplation of which might at once improve and mortify him. His path
      was not attended by an unapproachable mirage of excellence, for ever
      receding, and for ever pursued. He was not disgusted by the negligence of
      others; and he extended the same toleration to himself. His mind was of a
      slovenly character,&mdash;fond of splendour, but indifferent to neatness.
      Hence most of his writings exhibit the sluttish magnificence of a Russian
      noble, all vermin and diamonds, dirty linen and inestimable sables. Those
      faults which spring from affectation, time and thought in a great measure
      removed from his poems. But his carelessness he retained to the last. If
      towards the close of his life he less frequently went wrong from
      negligence, it was only because long habits of composition rendered it
      more easy to go right. In his best pieces we find false rhymes,&mdash;triplets,
      in which the third line appears to be a mere intruder, and, while it
      breaks the music, adds nothing to the meaning,&mdash;gigantic Alexandrines
      of fourteen and sixteen syllables, and truncated verses for which he never
      troubled himself to find a termination or a partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are the beauties and the faults which may be found in profusion
      throughout the later works of Dry-den. A more just and complete estimate
      of his natural and acquired powers,&mdash;of the merits of his style and
      of its blemishes,&mdash;may be formed from the Hind and <span
      class="pagenum">372</span><a name="link372" id="link372"></a>Panther,
      than from any of his other writings. As a didactic poem, it is far
      superior to the Religio Laici. The satirical parts, particularly the
      character of Burnet, are scarcely inferior to the best passages in Absalom
      and Achitophel. There are, moreover, occasional touches of a tenderness
      which effects us more, because it is decent, rational, and manly, and
      reminds us of the best scenes in his tragedies. His versification sinks
      and swells in happy unison with the subject; and his wealth of language
      seems to be unlimited. Yet, the carelessness with which he has constructed
      his plot, and the innumerable inconsistencies into which he is every
      moment falling, detract much from the pleasure which such various
      excellence affords.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Absalom and Achitophel he hit upon a new and rich vein, which he worked
      with signal success. The ancient satirists were the subjects of a despotic
      government. They were compelled to abstain from political topics, and to
      confine their attention to the frailties of private life. They might,
      indeed, sometimes venture to take liberties with public men, &ldquo;Quorum
      Flaminia tegitur cinis atque Latina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus Juvenal immortalised the obsequious senators who met to decide the
      fate of the memorable turbot. His fourth satire frequently reminds us of
      the great political poem of Dryden; but it was not written till Domitian
      had fallen: and it wants something of the peculiar flavour which belongs
      to contemporary invective alone. His anger has stood so long that, though
      the body is not impaired, the effervescence, the first cream, is gone.
      Boileau lay under similar restraints; and, if he had been free from all
      restraint, would have been no match for our countryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advantages which Dryden derived from the nature <span class="pagenum">373</span><a
      name="link373" id="link373"></a>of his subject he improved to the very
      utmost. His maimer is almost perfect. The style of Horace and Boileau is
      fit only for light subjects. The Frenchman did indeed attempt to turn the
      theological reasonings of the Provincial Letters into verse, but with very
      indifferent success. The glitter of Pope is cold. The ardour of Persius is
      without brilliancy. Magnificent versification and ingenious combinations
      rarely harmonise with the expression of deep feeling. In Juvenal and
      Dryden alone we have the sparkle and the heat together. Those great
      satirists succeeded in communicating; the fervour of their feelings to
      materials the most incombustible, and kindled the whole mass into a blaze,
      at once dazzling and destructive. We cannot, indeed, think, without
      regret, of the part which so eminent a writer as Dryden took in the
      disputes of that period. There was, no doubt, madness and wickedness on
      both sides. But there was liberty on the one, and despotism on the other.
      On this point, however, we will not dwell. At Talavera the English and
      French troops for a moment suspended their conflict, to drink of a stream
      which flowed between them. The shells were passed across from enemy to
      enemy without apprehension or molestation. We, in the same manner, would
      rather assist our political adversaries to drink with us of that fountain
      of intellectual pleasure, which should be the common refreshment of both
      parties, than disturb and pollute it with the havock of unseasonable
      hostilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Macflenoe is inferior to Absalom and Achitophel, only in the subject. In
      the execution it is even superior. But the greatest work of Dryden was the
      last, the Ode on Saint Cecilia&rsquo;s day. It is the master-piece of the second
      class of poetry, and ranks but just below <span class="pagenum">374</span><a
      name="link374" id="link374"></a>the great models of the first. It reminds
      us of the Pedasus of Achilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      By comparing it with the impotent ravings of the heroic tragedies, we may
      measure the progress which the mind of Dryden had made. He had learned to
      avoid a too audacious competition with higher natures, to keep at a
      distance from the verge of bombast or nonsense, to venture on no
      expression which did not convey a distinct idea to his own mind. There is
      none of that &ldquo;darkness visible&rdquo; of style which he had formerly affected,
      and in which the greatest poets only can succeed. Everything is definite,
      significant, and picturesque. His early writings resembled the gigantic
      works of those Chinese gardeners who attempt to rival nature herself, to
      form cataracts of terrific height and sound, to raise precipitous ridges
      of mountains, and to imitate in artificial plantations the vastness and
      the gloom of some primeval forest. This manner he abandoned; nor did he
      ever adopt the Dutch taste which Pope affected, the trim parterres, and
      the rectangular walks. He rather resembled our Kents and Browns, who,
      imitating the great features of landscape without emulating them,
      consulting the genius of the place, assisting nature and carefully
      disguising their art, produced, not a Chainouni or a Niagara, but a Stowe
      or a Hagley.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are, on the whole, inclined to regret that Dryden did not accomplish
      his purpose of writing an epic poem. It certainly would not have been a
      work of the highest rank. It would not have rivalled the Iliad, the
      Odyssey, or the Paradise Lost; but it would have been superior to the
      productions of Apollonius, Lucan, or Statius, and not inferior to the
      Jerusalem Delivered. <span class="pagenum">375</span><a name="link375"
       id="link375"></a>It would probably have been a vigorous narrative,
      animated with something of the spirit of the old romances, enriched with
      much splendid description, and interspersed with fine declamations and
      disquisitions. The danger of Dryden would have been from aiming too high;
      from dwelling too much, for example, on his angels of kingdoms, and
      attempting a competition with that great writer who in his own time had so
      incomparably succeeded in representing to us the sights and sounds of
      another world. To Milton, and to Milton alone, belonged the secrets of the
      great deep, the beach of sulphur, the ocean of fire, the palaces of the
      fallen dominations, glimmering through the everlasting shade, the silent
      wilderness of verdure and fragrance where armed angels kept watch over the
      sleep of the first lovers, the portico of diamond, the sea of jasper, the
      sapphire pavement empurpled with celestial roses, and the infinite ranks
      of the Cherubim, blazing with adamant and gold. The council, the
      tournament, the procession, the crowded cathedral, the camp, the
      guardroom, the chase, were the proper scenes for Dryden.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we have not space to pass in review all the works which Dryden wrote.
      We, therefore, will not speculate longer on those which he might possibly
      have written. He may, on the whole, be pronounced to have been a man
      possessed of splendid talents, which he often abused, and of a sound
      judgment, the admonitions of which he often neglected; a man who succeeded
      only in an inferior department of his art, but who, in that department,
      succeeded pre-eminently; and who, with a more independent spirit, a more
      anxious desire of excellence, and more respect for himself, would, in his
      own walk, have attained to absolute perfection.

      scientific works are, in their kind, absolutely perfect. There are poems
      which we should be inclined to designate as faultless, or as disfigured
      only by blemishes which pass unnoticed in the general blaze of excellence.
      There are speeches, some speeches of Demosthenes particularly, in which it
      would be impossible to alter a word without altering it for the worse. But
      we are acquainted with no history which approaches to our notion of what a

    </p>
    <p>
      The cause may easily be assigned. This province of literature is a
      debatable land. It lies on the confines of two distinct territories. It is
      under the

</pre>
    <p>
      jurisdiction <span class="pagenum">377</span><a name="link377"
       id="link377"></a>of two hostile powers; and, like other districts
      similarly situated, it is ill-defined, ill cultivated, and ill regulated.
      Instead of being equally shared between its two rulers, the Reason and the
      Imagination, it falls alternately under the sole and absolute dominion of
      each. It is sometimes fiction. It is sometimes theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      History, it has been said, is philosophy teaching by examples. Unhappily,
      what the philosophy gains in soundness and depth the examples generally
      lose in vividness. A perfect historian must possess an imagination
      sufficiently powerful to make his narrative affecting and picturesque. Yet
      he must control it so absolutely as to content himself with the materials
      which he finds, and to refrain from supplying deficiencies by additions of
      his own. He must be a profound and ingenious reasoner. Yet he must possess
      sufficient self-command to abstain from casting his facts in the mould of
      his hypothesis. Those who can justly estimate these almost insuperable
      difficulties will not think it strange that every writer should have
      failed, either in the narrative or in the speculative department of
      history.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be laid down as a general rule, though subject to considerable
      qualifications and exceptions, that <i>history begins in novel and ends in
      essay</i>. Of the romantic historians Herodotus is the earliest and the
      best. His animation, his simple-hearted tenderness, his wonderful talent
      for description and dialogue, and the pure sweet flow of his language,
      place him at the head of narrators. He reminds us of a delightful child.
      There is a grace beyond the reach of affectation in his awkwardness, a
      malice in his innocence, an intelligence in his nonsense, an insinuating
      eloquence in his lisp. We know of no writer who makes such <span
      class="pagenum">378</span><a name="link378" id="link378"></a>interest
      for himself and his hook in the heart of the reader. At the distance of
      three-and-twenty centuries, we feel for him the same sort of pitying
      fondness which Fontaine and Gay are said to have inspired in society. He
      has written an incomparable book. He has written something better perhaps
      than the best history; but he has not written a good history; he is, from
      the first to the last chapter, an inventor. We do not here refer merely to
      those gross fictions with which he has been reproached by the critics of
      later times. We speak of that colouring which is equally diffused over his
      whole narrative, and which perpetually leaves the most sagacious reader in
      doubt what to reject and what to receive. The most authentic parts of his
      work bear the same relation to his wildest legends which Henry the Fifth
      bears to the Tempest. There was an expedition undertaken by Xerxes against
      Greece; and there was an invasion of France. There was a battle at Platæa;
      and there was a battle at Agincourt. Cambridge and Exeter, the Constable
      and the Dauphin, were persons as real as Demaratus and Pausa-nias. The
      harangue of the Archbishop on the Salic Law and the Book of Numbers
      differs much less from the orations which have in all ages proceeded from
      the right reverend bench than the speeches of Mardonius and Artabanus from
      those which were delivered at the council-board of Susa. Shakspeare gives
      us enumerations of armies, and returns of killed and wounded, which are
      not, we suspect, much less accurate than those of Herodotus. There are
      passages in Herodotus nearly as long as acts of Shakspeare, in which
      everything is told dramatically, and in which the narrative serves only
      the purpose of stage-directions. It is possible, no doubt, that the
      substance of some real conversations<span class="pagenum">379</span><a
      name="link379" id="link379"></a> may have been reported to the historian.
      But events, which, if they ever happened, happened in ages and nations so
      remote that the particulars could never have been known to him, are
      related with the greatest minuteness of detail. We have all that Candaules
      said to Gyges, and all that passed between Astyages and Harpagus. We are,
      therefore, unable to judge whether, in the account which he gives of
      transactions respecting which he might possibly have been well informed,
      we can trust to anything beyond the naked outline; whether, for example,
      the answer of Gelon to the ambassadors of the Grecian confederacy, or the
      expressions which passed between Aristides and Themistocles at their
      famous interview, have been correctly transmitted to us. The great events,
      are, no doubt, faithfully related. So, probably, are many of the slighter
      circumstances; but which of them it is impossible to ascertain. The
      fictions are so much like the facts, and the facts so much like the
      fictions, that, with respect to many most interesting particulars, our
      belief is neither given nor withheld, but remains in an uneasy and
      interminable state of abeyance. We know that there is truth; but we cannot
      exactly decide where it lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faults of Herodotus are the faults of a simple and imaginative mind.
      Children and servants are remarkably Herodotean in their style of
      narration. They tell everything dramatically. Their <i>says hes</i> and <i>says
      shes</i> are proverbial. Every person who has had to settle their disputes
      knows that, even when they have no intention to deceive, their reports of
      conversation always require to be carefully sifted. If an educated man
      were giving an account of the late change of administration, he would say&mdash;&ldquo;Lord
      Goderich resigned; <span class="pagenum">380</span><a name="link380"
       id="link380"></a>and the King, in consequence, sent for the Duke of
      Wellington.&rdquo; A porter tells the story as if he had been hid behind the
      curtains of the royal bed at Windsor: &ldquo;So Lord Goderich says, &lsquo;I cannot
      manage this business; I must go out.&rsquo; So the King says,&mdash;says he,
      &lsquo;Well, then, I must send for the Duke of Wellington&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;&rdquo;
       This is in the very manner of the father of history.

      Herodotus wrote as it was natural that he should write. He wrote for a
      nation susceptible, curious, lively, insatiably desirous of novelty and
      excitement; for a nation in which the fine arts had attained their highest
      excellence, but in which philosophy was still in its infancy. His
      countrymen had but recently begun to cultivate prose composition. Public
      transactions had generally been recorded in verse. The first historians
      might, therefore, indulge without fear of censure in the license allowed
      to their predecessors the bards. Books were few. The events of former
      times were learned from tradition and from popular ballads; the manners of
      foreign countries from the reports of travellers. It is well known that
      the mystery which overhangs what is distant, either in space or time,
      frequently prevents us from censuring as unnatural what we perceive to be
      impossible. We stare at a dragoon who has killed three French cuirassiers,
      as a prodigy; yet we read, without the least disgust, how Godfrey slew his
      thousands, and Rinaldo his ten thousands. Within the last hundred years,
      stories about China and Bantam, which ought not to have imposed on an old
      nurse, were gravely laid down as foundations of political theories by
      eminent philosophers. What the time of the Crusades is to us, the
      generation of Croesus and Solon was to the Greeks of the time of
      Herodotus. Babylon <span class="pagenum">381</span><a name="link381"
       id="link381"></a>was to them what Pekin was to the French academicians of
      the last century.
    </p>
    <p>
      For such a people was the book of Herodotus composed; and, if we may trust
      to a report, not sanctioned indeed by writers of high authority, but in
      itself not improbable, it was composed, not to be read, but to be heard.
      It was not to the slow circulation of a few copies, which the rich only
      could possess, that the aspiring author looked for his reward. The great
      Olympian festival,&mdash;the solemnity which collected multitudes, proud
      of the Grecian name, from the wildest mountains of Doris, and the remotest
      colonies of Italy and Libya,&mdash;was to witness his triumph. The
      interest of the narrative, and the beauty of the style, were aided by the
      imposing effect of recitation,&mdash;by the splendour of the spectacle,&mdash;by
      the powerful influence of sympathy. A critic who could have asked for
      authorities in the midst of such a scene must have been of a cold and
      sceptical nature; and few such critics were there: As was the historian,
      such were the auditors,&mdash;inquisitive, credulous, easily moved by
      religious awe or patriotic enthusiasm. They were the very men to hear with
      delight of strange beasts, and birds, and trees,&mdash;of dwarfs, and
      giants, and cannibals,&mdash;of gods, whose very names it was impiety to
      utter,&mdash;of ancient dynasties, which had left behind them monuments
      surpassing all the works of later times,&mdash;of towns like provinces,&mdash;of
      rivers like seas,&mdash;of stupendous walls, and temples, and pyramids,&mdash;of
      the rites which the Magi performed at daybreak on the tops of the
      mountains,&mdash;of the secrets inscribed on the eternal obelisks of
      Memphis. With equal delight they would have listened to the graceful
      romances of their own country. They now heard of the exact <span
      class="pagenum">382</span><a name="link382" id="link382"></a>accomplishment
      of obscure predictions, of the punishment of crimes over which the justice
      of heaven had seemed to slumber,&mdash;of dreams, omens, warnings from the
      dead,&mdash;of princesses, for whom noble suitors contended in every
      generous exercise of strength and skill,&mdash;of infants, strangely
      preserved from the dagger of the assassin, to fulfil high destinies.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the narrative approached their own times, the interest became still
      more absorbing. The chronicler had now to tell the story of that great
      conflict from which Europe dates its intellectual and political supremacy,&mdash;a
      story which, even at this distance of time, is the most marvellous and the
      most touching in the annals of the human race,&mdash;a story abounding
      with all that is wild and wonderful, with all that is pathetic and
      animating; with the gigantic caprices of infinite wealth and despotic
      power&mdash;with the mightier miracles of wisdom, of virtue, and of
      courage. He told them of rivers dried up in a day,&mdash;of provinces
      famished for a meal,&mdash;of a passage for ships hewn through the
      mountains,&mdash;of a road for armies spread upon the waves,&mdash;of
      monarchies and commonwealths swept away,&mdash;of anxiety, of terror, of
      confusion, of despair!&mdash;and then of proud and stubborn hearts tried
      in that extremity of evil, and not found wanting,&mdash;of resistance long
      maintained against desperate odds,&mdash;of lives dearly sold, when
      resistance could be maintained no more,&mdash;of signal deliverance, and
      of unsparing revenge. Whatever gave a stronger air of reality to a
      narrative so well calculated to inflame the passions, and to flatter
      national pride, was certain to be favourably received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the time at which Herodotus is said to have composed his history,
      and the close of the Peloponnesian <span class="pagenum">383</span><a
      name="link383" id="link383"></a>war, about forty years elapsed,&mdash;forty
      years, crowded with great military and political events. The circumstances
      of that period produced a great effect on the Grecian character; and
      nowhere was this effect so remarkable as in the illustrious democracy of
      Athens. An Athenian, indeed, even in the time of Herodotus, would scarcely
      have written a book so romantic and garrulous as that of Herodotus. As
      civilisation advanced, the citizens of that famous republic became still
      less visionary, and still less simple-hearted. They aspired to know where
      their ancestors had been content to doubt; they began to doubt where their
      ancestors had thought it their duty to believe. Aristophanes is fond of
      alluding to this change in the temper of his countrymen. The father and
      son, in the Clouds, are evidently representatives of the generations to
      which they respectively belonged. Nothing more clearly illustrates the
      nature of this moral revolution than the change which passed upon tragedy.
      The wild sublimity of Æschylus became the scoff of every young
      Phidippides. Lectures on abstruse points of philosophy, the fine
      distinctions of casuistry, and the dazzling fence of rhetoric, were
      substituted for poetry. The language lost something of that infantine
      sweetness which had characterised it. It became less like the ancient
      Tuscan, and more like the modern French.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fashionable logic of the Greeks, was, indeed, far from strict. Logic
      never can be strict where books are scarce, and where information is
      conveyed orally. We are all aware how frequently fallacies, which, when
      set down on paper, are at once detected, pass for unanswerable arguments
      when dexterously and volubly urged in Parliament, at the bar, or in
      private conversation. The reason is evident. We cannot inspect <span
      class="pagenum">384</span><a name="link384" id="link384"></a>them
      closely enough to perceive their inaccuracy. We cannot readily compare
      them with each other. We lose sight of one part of the subject before
      another, which ought to be received in connection with it, comes before
      us; and, as there is no immutable record of what has been admitted and of
      what has been denied, direct contradictions pass muster with little
      difficulty. Almost all the education of a Greek consisted in talking and
      listening. His opinions on government were picked up in the debates of the
      assembly. If he wished to study metaphysics, instead of shutting himself
      up with a book, he walked down to the market-place to look for a sophist.
      So completely were men formed to these habits, that even writing acquired
      a conversational air. The philosophers adopted the form of dialogue, as
      the most natural mode of communicating knowledge. Their reasonings have
      the merits and the defects which belong to that species of composition,
      and are characterised rather by quickness and subtilty than by depth and
      precision. Truth is exhibited in parts, and by glimpses. Innumerable
      clever hints are given; but no sound and durable system is erected. The <i>argumentum
      ad hominem</i>, a kind of argument most efficacious in debate, but utterly
      useless for the investigation of general principles, is among their
      favourite resources. Hence, though nothing can be more admirable than the
      skill which Socrates displays in the conversations which Plato has
      reported or invented, his victories, for the most part, seem to us
      unprofitable. A trophy is set up; but no new province is added to the
      dominions of the human mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, where thousands of keen and ready intellects were constantly
      employed in speculating on the qualities <span class="pagenum">385</span><a
      name="link385" id="link385"></a>of actions and on the principles of
      government, it was impossible that history should retain its old
      character. It became less gossiping and less picturesque; but much more
      accurate, and somewhat more scientific.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of Thucydides differs from that of Herodotus as a portrait
      differs from the representation of an imaginary scene; as the Burke or Fox
      of Reynolds differs from his Ugolino or his Beaufort. In the former ease,
      the archetype is given: in the latter, it is created. The faculties which
      are required for the latter purpose are of a higher and rarer order than
      those which suffice for the former, and indeed necessarily comprise them.
      He who is able to paint what he sees with the eye of the mind will surely
      be able to paint what he sees with the eye of the body. He who can invent
      a story, and tell it well, will also be able to tell, in an interesting
      manner, a story which he has not invented. If, in practice, some of the
      best writers of fiction have been among the worst writers of history, it
      has been because one of their talents had merged in another so completely
      that it could not be severed; because, having long been habituated to
      invent and narrate at the same time, they found it impossible to narrate
      without inventing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some capricious and discontented artists have affected to consider
      portrait-painting as unworthy of a man of genius. Some critics have spoken
      in the same contemptuous manner of history. Johnson puts the case thus:
      The historian tells either what is false or what is true: in the former
      case he is no historian: in the latter he has no opportunity for
      displaying his abilities: for truth is one: and all who tell the truth
      must tell it alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not difficult to elude both the horns of this <span class="pagenum">386</span><a
      name="link386" id="link386"></a>dilemma. We will recur to the analogous
      art of portrait-painting. Any man with eyes and hands may be taught to
      take a likeness. The process, up to a certain point, is merely mechanical.
      If this were all, a man of talents might justly despise the occupation.
      But we could mention portraits which are resemblances,&mdash;but not mere
      resemblances; faithful,&mdash;but much more than faithful; portraits which
      condense into one point of time, and exhibit, at a single glance, the
      whole history of turbid and eventful lives&mdash;in which the eye seems to
      scrutinise us, and the mouth to command us&mdash;in which the brow
      menaces, and the lip almost quivers with scorn&mdash;in which every
      wrinkle is a comment on some important transaction. The account which
      Thucydides has given of the retreat from Syracuse is, among narratives,
      what Vandyk&rsquo;s Lord Strafford is among paintings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diversity, it is said, implies error: truth is one, and admits of no
      degrees. We answer, that this principle holds good only in abstract
      reasonings. When we talk of the truth of imitation in the fine arts, we
      mean an imperfect and a graduated truth. No picture is exactly like the
      original; nor is a picture good in proportion as it is like the original.
      When Sir Thomas Lawrence paints a handsome peeress, he does not
      contemplate her through a powerful microscope, and transfer to the canvas
      the pores of the skin, the blood-vessels of the eye, and all the other
      beauties which Gulliver discovered in the Brobdignaggian maids of honour.
      If he were to do this, the effect would not merely be unpleasant, but,
      unless the scale of the picture were proportionably enlarged, would be
      absolutely <i>false</i>. And, after all, a microscope of greater power
      than that which he had employed would convict him of innumerable <span
      class="pagenum">387</span><a name="link387" id="link387"></a>omissions.
      The same may be said of history. Perfectly and absolutely true it cannot
      be: for, to be perfectly and absolutely true, it ought to record <i>all</i>
      the slightest particulars of the slightest transactions&mdash;all the
      things done and all the words uttered during the time of which it treats.
      The omission of any circumstance, however insignificant, would be a
      defect. If history were written thus, the Bodleian library would not
      contain the occurrences of a week. What is told in the fullest and most
      accurate annals bears an infinitely small proportion to what is
      suppressed. The difference between the copious work of Clarendon and the
      account of the civil wars in the abridgment of Goldsmith vanishes when
      compared with the immense mass of facts respecting which both are equally
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      No picture, then, and no history, can present us with the whole truth: but
      those are the best pictures and the best histories which exhibit such
      parts of the truth as most nearly produce the effect of the whole. He who
      is deficient in the art of selection may, by showing nothing but the
      truth, produce all the effect of the grossest falsehood. It perpetually
      happens that one writer tells less truth than another, merely because he
      tells more truths. In the imitative arts we constantly see this. There are
      lines in the human face, and objects in landscape, which stand in such
      relations to each other, that they ought either to be all introduced into
      a painting together or all omitted together. A sketch into which none of
      them enters may be excellent; but, if some are given and others left out,
      though there are more points of likeness, there is less likeness. An
      outline scrawled with a pen, which seizes the marked features of a
      countenance, will give a much stronger idea of it than a bad painting in
      oils. Yet <span class="pagenum">388</span><a name="link388"
       id="link388"></a>the worst painting in oils that ever hung at Somerset
      House resembles the original in many more particulars. A bust of white
      marble may give an excellent idea of a blooming face. Colour the lips and
      cheeks of the bust, leaving the hair and eyes unaltered, and the
      similarity, instead of being; more striking, will be less so.
    </p>
    <p>
      History has its foreground and its background: and it is principally in
      the management of its perspective that one artist differs from another.
      Some events must be represented on a large scale, others diminished; the
      great majority will be lost in the dimness of the horizon; and a general
      idea of their joint effect will be given by a few slight touches.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this respect no writer has ever equalled Thucydides. He was a perfect
      master of the art of gradual diminution. His history is sometimes as
      concise as a chronological chart; yet it is always perspicuous. It is
      sometimes as minute as one of Lovelace&rsquo;s letters; yet it is never prolix.
      He never fails to contract and to expand it in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thucydides borrowed from Herodotus the practice of putting speeches of his
      own into the mouths of his characters. In Herodotus this usage is scarcely
      censurable. It is of a piece with his whole manner. But it is altogether
      incongruous in the work of his successor, and violates, not only the
      accuracy of history, but the decencies of fiction. When once we enter into
      the spirit of Herodotus, we find no inconsistency. The conventional
      probability of his drama is preserved from the beginning to the end. The
      deliberate orations, and the familiar dialogues are in strict keeping with
      each other. But the speeches of Thucydides are neither preceded nor
      followed by anything with which they harmonise. They give to the whole
      book something <span class="pagenum">389</span><a name="link389"
       id="link389"></a>of the grotesque character of those Chinese
      pleasure-grounds in which perpendicular rocks of granite start up in the
      midst of a soft green plain. Invention is shocking where truth is in such
      close juxtaposition with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thucydides honestly tells us that some of these discourses are purely
      fictitious. He may have reported the substance of others correctly. But it
      is clear from the internal evidence that he has preserved no more than the
      substance. His own peculiar habits of thought and expression are
      everywhere discernible. Individual and national peculiarities are seldom
      to be traced in the sentiments, and never in the diction. The oratory of
      the Corinthians and Thebans is not less Attic, either in matter or in
      manner, than that of the Athenians. The style of Cleon is as pure, as
      austere, as terse, and as significant, as that of Pericles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this great fault, it must be allowed that Thucydides has
      surpassed all his rivals in the art of historical narration, in the art of
      producing an effect on the imagination, by skilful selection and
      disposition, without indulging in the license of invention. But narration,
      though an important part of the business of a historian, is not the whole.
      To append a moral to a work of fiction is either useless or superfluous. A
      fiction may give a more impressive effect to what is already known; but it
      can teach nothing new. If it presents to us characters and trains of
      events to which our experience furnishes us with nothing similar, instead
      of deriving instruction from it, we pronounce it unnatural. We do not form
      our opinions from it; but we try it by our preconceived opinions. Fiction,
      therefore, is essentially imitative. Its merit consists in its resemblance
      to a model with which we are al ready <span class="pagenum">390</span><a
      name="link390" id="link390"></a>familiar, or to which at least we can
      instantly refer. Hence it is that the anecdotes which interest us most
      strongly in authentic narrative are offensive when introduced into novels;
      that what is called the romantic part of history is in fact the least
      romantic. It is delightful as history, because it contradicts our previous
      notions of human nature, and of the connection of causes and effects. It
      is, on that very account, shocking and incongruous in fiction. In fiction,
      the principles are given, to find the facts: in history, the facts are
      given, to find the principles; and the writer who does not explain the
      phenomena as well as state them performs only one half of his office.
      Facts are the mere dross of history. It is from the abstract truth which
      interpenetrates them, and lies latent among them like gold in the ore,
      that the mass derives its whole value: and the precious particles are
      generally combined with the baser in such a manner that the separation is
      a task of the utmost difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Thucydides is deficient: the deficiency, indeed, is not discreditable
      to him. It was the inevitable effect of circumstances. It was in the
      nature of things necessary that, in some part of its progress through
      political science, the human mind should reach that point which it
      attained in his time. Knowledge advances by steps, and not by leaps. The
      axioms of an English debating club would have been startling and
      mysterious paradoxes to the most enlightened statesmen of Athens. But it
      would be as absurd to speak contemptuously of the Athenian on this account
      as to ridicule Strabo for not having given us an account of Chili, or to
      talk of Ptolemy as we talk of Sir Richard Phillips. Still, when we wish
      for solid geographical information, we must prefer the solemn coxcombry of
      <span class="pagenum">391</span><a name="link391" id="link391"></a>Pinkerton
      to the noble work of Strabo. If we wanted instruction respecting the solar
      system, we should consult the silliest girl from a boarding school, rather
      than Ptolemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thucydides was undoubtedly a sagacious and reflecting man. This clearly
      appears from the ability with which he discusses practical questions. But
      the talent of deciding on the circumstances of a particular case is often
      possessed in the highest perfection by persons destitute of the power of
      generalisation. Men skilled in the military tactics of civilised nations
      have been amazed at the far-sightedness and penetration which a Mohawk
      displays in concerting his stratagems, or in discerning those of his
      enemies. In England, no class possesses so much of that peculiar ability
      which is required for constructing ingenious schemes, and for obviating
      remote difficulties, as the thieves and the thief-takers. Women have more
      of this dexterity than men. Lawyers have more of it than statesmen:
      statesmen have more of it than philosophers. Monk had more of it than
      Harrington and all his club. Walpole had more of it than Adam Smith or
      Beccaria. Indeed, the species of discipline by which this dexterity is
      acquired tends to contract the mind, and to render it incapable of
      abstract reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grecian statesmen of the age of Thucydides were distinguished by their
      practical sagacity, their insight into motives, their skill in devising
      means for the attainment of their ends. A state of society in winch the
      rich were constantly planning the oppression of the poor, and the poor the
      spoliation of the rich, in which the ties of party had superseded those of
      country, in which revolutions and counter revolutions were events of daily
      occurrence, was naturally prolific <span class="pagenum">392</span><a
      name="link392" id="link392"></a>in desperate and crafty political
      adventurers. This was the very school in which men were likely to acquire
      the dissimulation of Mazarin, the judicious temerity of Richelieu, the
      penetration, the exquisite tact, the almost instinctive presentiment of
      approaching events which gave so much authority to the counsel of
      Shaftesbury that &ldquo;it was as if a man had inquired of the oracle of God.&rdquo;
       In this school Thucydides studied; and his wisdom is that which such a
      school would naturally afford. He judges better of circumstances than of
      principles. The more a question is narrowed, the better he reasons upon
      it. His work suggests many most important considerations respecting the
      first principles of government and morals, the growth of factions, the
      organisation of armies, and the mutual relations of communities. Yet all
      his general observations on these subjects are very superficial. His most
      judicious remarks differ from the remarks of a really philosophical
      historian, as a sum correctly cast up by a book-keeper from a general
      expression discovered by an algebraist. The former is useful only in a
      single transaction; the latter may be applied to an infinite number of
      cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      This opinion will, we fear, be considered as heterodox. For, not to speak
      of the illusion which the sight of a Greek type, or the sound of a Greek
      dip-thong, often produces, there are some peculiarities in the manner of
      Thucydides which in no small degree have tended to secure to him the
      reputation of profundity. His book is evidently the book of a man and a
      statesman; and in this respect presents a remarkable contrast to the
      delightful childishness of Herodotus. Throughout it there is an air of
      matured power, of grave and melancholy reflection, of impartiality and
      <span class="pagenum">393</span><a name="link393" id="link393"></a>habitual
      self-command. His feelings are rarely indulged, and speedily repressed.
      Vulgar prejudices of every kind, and particularly vulgar superstitions, he
      treats with a cold and sober disdain peculiar to himself. His style is
      weighty, condensed, antithetical, and not unfrequently obscure. But, when
      we look at his political philosophy, without regard to these
      circumstances, we find him to have been, what indeed it would have been a
      miracle if he had not been, simply an Athenian of the fifth century before
      Christ.

      Xenophon is commonly placed, but we think without much reason, in the same
      rank with Herodotus and Thucydides. He resembles them, indeed, in the
      purity and sweetness of his style; but, in spirit, he rather resembles
      that later school of historians, whose works seem to be fables composed
      for a moral, and who, In their eagerness to give us warnings and examples,
      forget to give us men and women. The Life of Cyrus, whether we look upon
      it as a history or as a romance, seems to us a very wretched performance.
      The expedition of the Ten Thousand, and the History of Grecian Affairs,
      are certainly pleasant reading; but they indicate no great power of mind.
      In truth, Xenophon, though his taste was elegant, his disposition amiable,
      and his intercourse with the world extensive, had, we suspect, rather a
      weak head. Such was evidently the opinion of that extraordinary man to
      whom he early attached himself, and for whose memory he entertained an
      idolatrous veneration. He came in only for the milk with which Socrates
      nourished his babes in philosophy. A few saws of morality, and a few of
      the simplest doctrines of natural religion, were enough for the good young
      man. The strong meat, the bold speculations on physical and metaphysical
      science, were <span class="pagenum">394</span><a name="link394"
       id="link394"></a>reserved for auditors of a different description. Even
      the lawless habits of a captain of mercenary troops could not change the
      tendency which the character of Xenophon early acquired. To the last, he
      seems to have retained a sort of heathen Puritanism. The sentiments of
      piety and virtue which abound in his works are those of a well-meaning
      man, somewhat timid and narrow-minded, devout from constitution rather
      than from rational conviction. He was as superstitious as Herodotus, but
      in a way far more offensive. The very peculiarities which charm us in an
      infant, the toothless mumbling, the stammering, the tottering, the
      helplessness, the causeless tears and laughter, are disgusting in old age.
      In the same manner, the absurdity which precedes a period of general
      intelligence is often pleasing; that which follows it is contemptible. The
      nonsense of Herodotus is that of a baby. The nonsense of Xenophon is that
      of a dotard. His stories about dreams, omens, and prophecies, present a
      strange contrast to the passages in which the shrewd and incredulous
      Thucydides mentions the popular superstitions. It is not quite clear that
      Xenophon was honest in his credulity;&rsquo; his fanaticism was in some degree
      politic. He would have made an excellent member of the Apostolic
      Camarilla. An alarmist by nature, an aristocrat by party, he carried to an
      unreasonable excess his horror of popular turbulence. The quiet atrocity
      of Sparta did not shock him in the same manner; for he hated tumult more
      than crimes. He was desirous to find restraints which might curb the
      passions of the multitude; and he absurdly fancied that he had found them
      in a religion without evidences or sanction, precepts or example, in a
      frigid system of rheophilanthropy, supported by nursery tales. <span
      class="pagenum">395</span><a name="link395" id="link395"></a>Polybius
      and Arrian have given us authentic accounts of facts; and here their merit
      ends. They were not men of comprehensive minds; they had not the art of
      telling a story in an interesting manner. They have in consequence been
      thrown into the shade by writers who, though less studious of truth than
      themselves, understood far better the art of producing effect,&mdash;by
      Livy and Quintus Curtius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Polybius and Arrian deserve high praise when compared with the writers
      of that school of which Plutarch may be considered as the head. For the
      historians of this class we must confess that we entertain a peculiar
      aversion. They seem to have been pedants, who, though destitute of those
      valuable qualities which are frequently found in conjunction with
      pedantry, thought themselves great philosophers and great politicians.
      They not only mislead their readers in every page, as to particular facts,
      but they appear to have altogether misconceived the whole character of the
      times of which they write. They were inhabitants of an empire bounded by
      the Atlantic Ocean and the Euphrates, by the ice of Scythia and the sands
      of Mauritania; composed of nations whose manners, whose languages, whose
      religion, whose countenances and complexions, were widely different;
      governed by one mighty despotism, which had risen on the ruins of a
      thousand commonwealths and kingdoms. Of liberty, such as it is in small
      democracies, of patriotism, such as it is in small independent communities
      of any kind, they had, and they could have, no experimental knowledge. But
      they had read of men who exerted themselves in the cause of their country
      with an energy unknown in later times, who had violated the dearest of
      domestic charities, or voluntarily devoted themselves to death, <span
      class="pagenum">396</span><a name="link396" id="link396"></a>for the
      public good; and they wondered at the degeneracy of their contemporaries.
      It never occurred to them that the feelings which they so greatly admired
      sprung from local and occasional causes; that they will always grow up
      spontaneously in small societies; and that, in large empires, though they
      may be forced into existence for a short time by peculiar circumstances,
      they cannot be general or permanent. It is impossible that any man should
      feel for a fortress on a remote frontier as he feels for his own house;
      that he should grieve for a defeat in which ten thousand people whom he
      never saw have fallen as he grieves for a defeat which has half unpeopled
      the street in which he lives; that he should leave his home for a military
      expedition in order to preserve the balance of power, as cheerfully as he
      would leave it to repel invaders who had begun to burn all the corn fields
      in his neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writers of whom we speak should have considered this. They should have
      considered that in patriotism, such as it existed amongst the Greeks,
      there was nothing essentially and eternally good; that an exclusive
      attachment to a particular society, though a natural, and, under certain
      restrictions, a most useful sentiment, implies no extraordinary
      attainments in wisdom or virtue; that, where it has existed in an intense
      degree, it has turned states into gangs of robbers whom their mutual
      fidelity has rendered more dangerous, has given a character of peculiar
      atrocity to war, and has generated that worst of all political evils, the
      tyranny of nations over nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enthusiastically attached to the name of liberty, these historians
      troubled themselves little about its definition. The Spartans, tormented
      by ten thousand absurd restraints, unable to please themselves in the
      <span class="pagenum">397</span><a name="link397" id="link397"></a>choice
      of their wives, their suppers, or their company, compelled to assume a
      peculiar manner, and to talk in a peculiar style, gloried in their
      liberty. The aristocracy of Rome repeatedly made liberty a plea for
      cutting off the favourites of the people. In almost all the little
      commonwealths of antiquity, liberty was used as a pretext for measures
      directed against everything which makes liberty valuable, for measures
      which stifled discussion, corrupted the administration of justice, and
      discouraged the accumulation of property. The writers, whose works we are
      considering, confounded the sound with the substance, and the means with
      the end. Their imaginations were inflamed by mystery. They conceived of
      liberty as monks conceive of love, as cockneys conceive of the happiness
      and innocence of rural life, as novel-reading sempstresses conceive of
      Almack&rsquo;s and Grosvenor Square, accomplished Marquesses and handsome
      Colonels of the Guards. In the relation of events, and the delineation of
      characters, they have paid little attention to facts, to the costume of
      the times of which they pretend to treat, or to the general principles of
      human nature. They have been faithful only to their own puerile and
      extravagant doctrines. Generals and statesmen are metamorphosed into
      magnanimous coxcombs, from whose fulsome virtues we turn away with
      disgust. The fine sayings and exploits of their heroes remind us of the
      insufferable perfections of Sir Charles Grandison, and affect us with a
      nausea similar to that which we feel when an actor, in one of Morton&rsquo;s or
      Kotzebue&rsquo;s plays, lays his hand on his heart, advances to the
      ground-lights, and mouths a moral sentence for the edification of the
      gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      These writers, men who knew not what it was to have a country, men who had
      never enjoyed political <span class="pagenum">398</span><a
      name="link398" id="link398"></a>rights, brought into fashion an offensive
      cant about patriotism and zeal for freedom. What the English Puritans did
      for the language of Christianity, what Scuderi did for the language of
      love, they did for the language of public spirit. By habitual exaggeration
      they made it mean. By monotonous emphasis they made it feeble. They abused
      it till it became scarcely possible to use it with effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their ordinary rules of morality are deduced from extreme cases. The
      common regimen which they prescribe for society is made up of those
      desperate remedies which only its most desperate distempers require. They
      look with peculiar complacency on actions which even those who approve
      them consider as exceptions to laws of almost universal application&mdash;which
      bear so close an affinity to the most atrocious crimes that, even where it
      may be unjust to censure them, it is unsafe to praise them. It is not
      strange, therefore, that some flagitious instances of perfidy and cruelty
      should have been passed unchallenged in such company, that grave
      moralists, with no personal interest at stake, should have extolled, in
      the highest terms, deeds of which the atrocity appalled even the
      infuriated factions in whose cause they were perpetrated. The part which
      Timoleon took in the assassination of his brother shocked many of his own
      partisans. The recollection of it preyed long on his own mind. But it was
      reserved for historians who lived some centuries later to discover that
      his conduct was a glorious display of virtue, and to lament that, from the
      frailty of human nature, a man who could perform so great an exploit could
      repent of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writings of these men, and of their modern imitators, have produced
      effects which deserve some notice. <span class="pagenum">399</span><a
      name="link399" id="link399"></a>The English have been so long accustomed
      to political speculation, and have enjoyed so large a measure of practical
      liberty, that such works have produced little effect on their minds. We
      have classical associations and great names of our own which we can
      confidently oppose to the most splendid of ancient times. Senate has not
      to our ears a sound so venerable as Parliament. We respect the Great
      Charter more than the laws of Solon. The Capitol and the Forum impress us
      with less awe than our own Westminster Hall and Westminster Abbey, the
      place where the great men of twenty generations have contended, the place
      where they sleep together! The list of warriors and statesmen by whom our
      constitution was founded or preserved, from De Montfort down to Fox, may
      well stand a comparison with the Fasti of Rome. The dying thanksgiving of
      Sydney is as noble as the libation which Thrasea poured to Liberating
      Jove: and we think with far less pleasure of Cato tearing out his entrails
      than of Russell saying, as he turned away from his wife, that the
      bitterness of death was past. Even those parts of our history over which,
      on some accounts, we would gladly throw a veil may be proudly opposed to
      those on which the moralists of antiquity loved most to dwell. The enemy
      of English liberty was not murdered by men whom he had pardoned and loaded
      with benefits. He was not stabbed in the back by those who smiled and
      cringed before his face. He was vanquished on fields of stricken battle;
      he was arraigned, sentenced, and executed in the face of heaven and earth.
      Our liberty is neither Greek nor Roman; but essentially English. It has a
      character of its own,&mdash;a character which has taken a tinge from the
      sentiments of the chivalrous ages, and which accords with <span
      class="pagenum">400</span><a name="link400" id="link400"></a>the
      peculiarities of our manners and of our insular situation. It has a
      language, too, of its own, and a language singularly idiomatic, full of
      meaning to ourselves, scarcely intelligible to strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, therefore, the effect of books such as those which we have been
      considering has been harmless. They have, indeed, given currency to many
      very erroneous opinions with respect to ancient history. They have heated
      the imaginations of boys. They have misled the judgment and corrupted the
      taste of some men of letters, such as Akenside and Sir William Jones. But
      on persons engaged in public affairs they have had very little influence.
      The foundations of our constitution were laid by men who knew nothing of
      the Greeks but that they denied the orthodox procession and cheated the
      Crusaders; and nothing of Rome, but that the Pope lived there. Those who
      followed, contented themselves with improving on the original plan. They
      found models at home; and therefore they did not look for them abroad.
      But, when enlightened men on the Continent began to think about political
      reformation, having no patterns before their eyes in their domestic
      history, they naturally had recourse to those remains of antiquity, the
      study of which is considered throughout Europe as an important part of
      education. The historians of whom we have been speaking had been members
      of large communities, and subjects of absolute sovereigns. Hence it is, as
      we have already said, that they commit such gross errors in speaking of
      the little republics of antiquity. Their works were now read in the spirit
      in which they had been written. They were read by men placed in
      circumstances closely resembling their own, unacquainted with the real
      nature of liberty, but <span class="pagenum">401</span><a
      name="link401" id="link401"></a>inclined to believe everything good which
      could be told respecting it. How powerfully these books impressed these
      speculative reformers, is well known to all who have paid any attention to
      the French literature of the last century. But, perhaps, the writer on
      whom they produced the greatest effect was Vittorio Alfieri. In some of
      his plays, particularly in Virginia, Timoleon, and Brutus the Younger, he
      has even caricatured the extravagance of his masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not strange that the blind, thus led by the blind, should stumble.
      The transactions of the French Revolution, in some measure, took their
      character from these works. Without the assistance of these works, indeed,
      a revolution would have taken place,&mdash;a revolution productive of much
      good and much evil, tremendous but shortlived, evil dearly purchased, but
      durable good. But it would not have been exactly such a revolution. The
      style, the accessories, would have been in many respects different. There
      would have been less of bombast in language, less of affectation in
      manner, less of solemn trifling and ostentatious simplicity. The acts of
      legislative assemblies, and the correspondence of diplomatists, would not
      have been disgraced by rants worthy only of a college declamation. The
      government of a great and polished nation would not have rendered itself
      ridiculous by attempting to revive the usages of a world which had long
      passed away, or rather of a world which had never existed except in the
      description of a fantastic school of writers. These second-hand imitations
      resembled the originals about as much as the classical feast with which
      the Doctor in Peregrine Pickle turned the stomachs of all his guests
      resembled one of the suppers of Lucullus in the Hall of Apollo. <span
      class="pagenum">402</span><a name="link402" id="link402"></a>These
      were mere follies. But the spirit excited by these writers produced more
      serious effects. The greater part of the crimes which disgraced the
      revolution sprung indeed from the relaxation of law, from popular
      ignorance, from the remembrance of past oppression, from the fear of
      foreign conquest, from rapacity, from ambition, from party-spirit. But
      many atrocious proceedings must, doubtless, be ascribed to heated
      imagination, to perverted principle, to a distaste for what was vulgar in
      morals, and a passion for what was startling and dubious. Mr. Burke has
      touched on this subject with great felicity of expression: &ldquo;The gradation
      of their republic,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is laid in moral paradoxes. All those
      instances to be found in history, whether real or fabulous, of a doubtful
      public spirit, at which morality is perplexed, reason is staggered, and
      from which affrighted nature recoils, are their chosen and almost sole
      examples for the instruction of their youth.&rdquo; This evil, we believe, is to
      be directly ascribed to the influence of the historians whom we have
      mentioned, and their modern imitators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Livy had some faults in common with these writers. But on the whole he
      must be considered as forming a class by himself: no historian with whom
      we are acquainted has shown so complete an indifference to truth. He seems
      to have cared only about the picturesque effect of his book, and the
      honour of his country. On the other hand, we do not know, in the whole
      range of literature, an instance of a bad thing so well done. The painting
      of the narrative is beyond description vivid and graceful. The abundance
      of interesting sentiments and splendid imagery in the speeches is almost
      miraculous. His mind is a soil which is never overturned, a fountain which
      never seems to trickle. <span class="pagenum">403</span><a
      name="link403" id="link403"></a>It pours forth profusely; yet it gives no
      sign of exhaustion. It was probably to this exuberance of thought and
      language, always fresh, always sweet, always pure, no sooner yielded than
      repaired, that the critics applied that expression which has been so much
      discussed, <i>lactea ubertas</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the merits and all the defects of Livy take a colouring from the
      character of his nation. He was a writer peculiarly Roman; the proud
      citizen of a commonwealth which had indeed lost the reality of liberty,
      but which still sacredly preserved its forms&mdash;in fact the subject of
      an arbitrary prince, but in his own estimation one of the masters of the
      world, with a hundred kings below him, and only the gods above him. He,
      therefore, looked back on former times with feelings far different from
      those which were naturally entertained by his Greek contemporaries, and
      which at a later period became general among men of letters throughout the
      Roman Empire. He contemplated the past with interest and delight, not
      because it furnished a contrast to the present, but because it had led to
      the present. He recurred to it, not to lose in proud recollections the
      sense of national degradation, but to trace the progress of national
      glory. It is true that his veneration for antiquity produced on him some
      of the effects which it produced on those who arrived at it by a very
      different road. He has something of their exaggeration, something of their
      cant, something of their fondness for anomalies and <i>lusus naturo</i> in
      morality. Yet even here we perceive a difference. They talk rapturously of
      patriotism and liberty in the abstract. He does not seem to think any
      country but Rome deserving of love: nor is it for liberty as liberty, but
      for liberty as a part of the Roman institutions, that he is zealous. <span
      class="pagenum">404</span><a name="link404" id="link404"></a>Of the
      concise and elegant accounts of the campaigns of Caesar little can be
      said. They are incomparable models for military despatches. But histories
      they are not, and do not pretend to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient critics placed Sallust in the same rank with Livy; and
      unquestionably the small portion of his works which has come down to us is
      calculated to give a high opinion of his talents. But his style is not
      very pleasant: and his most powerful work, the account of the Conspiracy
      of Catiline, has rather the air of a clever party pamphlet than that of a
      history. It abounds with strange inconsistencies, which, unexplained as
      they are, necessarily excite doubts as to the fairness of the narrative.
      It is true, that many circumstances now forgotten may have been familiar
      to his contemporaries, and may have rendered passages clear to them which
      to us appear dubious and perplexing. But a great historian should remember
      that he writes for distant generations, for men who will perceive the
      apparent contradictions, and will possess no means of reconciling them. We
      can only vindicate the fidelity of Sallust at the expense of his skill.
      But in fact all the information which we have from contemporaries
      respecting this famous plot is liable to the same objection, and is read
      by discerning men with the same incredulity. It is all on one side. No
      answer has reached our times. Yet, on the showing of the accusers, the
      accused seem entitled to acquittal. Catiline, we are told, intrigued with
      a Vestal virgin, and murdered his own son. His house was a den of gamblers
      and debauchees. No young man could cross his threshold without danger to
      his fortune and reputation. Yet this is the man with whom Cicero was
      willing to coalesce in a contest for the first magistracy of the republic;
      <span class="pagenum">405</span><a name="link405" id="link405"></a>and
      whom he described, long after the fatal termination of the conspiracy, as
      an accomplished hypocrite, by whom he had himself been deceived, and who
      had acted with consummate skill the character of a good citizen and a good
      friend. We are told that the plot was the most wicked and desperate ever
      known, and, almost in the same breath, that the great body of the people,
      and many of the nobles, favoured it; that the richest citizens of Rome
      were eager for the spoliation of all property, and its highest
      functionaries for the destruction of all order; that Crassus, Cæsar, the
      Praetor Lentulus, one of the consuls of the year, one of the consuls
      elect, were proved or suspected to be engaged in a scheme for subverting
      institutions to which they owed the highest honours, and introducing
      universal anarchy. We are told that a government, which knew all this,
      suffered the conspirator, whose rank, talents, and courage, rendered him
      most dangerous, to quit Rome without molestation. We are told that bondmen
      and gladiators were to be armed against the citizens. Yet we find that
      Catiline rejected the slaves who crowded to enlist in his army, lest, as
      Sallust himself expresses it, &ldquo;he should seem to identify their cause
      until that of the citizens.&rdquo; Finally, we are told that the magistrate, who
      was universally allowed to have saved all classes of his countrymen from
      conflagration and massacre, rendered himself so unpopular by his conduct
      that a marked insult was offered to him at the expiration of his office,
      and a severe punishment inflicted on him shortly after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sallust tells us, what, indeed, the letters and speeches of Cicero
      sufficiently prove, that some persons considered the shocking and
      atrocious part of the plot as mere inventions of the government, designed
      to excuse <span class="pagenum">406</span><a name="link406"
       id="link406"></a>its unconstitutional measures. We must confess ourselves
      to be of that opinion. There was, undoubtedly, a strong party desirous to
      change the administration. While Pompey held the command of an army, they
      could not effect their purpose without preparing means for repelling
      force, if necessary, by force. In all this there is nothing different from
      the ordinary practice of Roman factions. The other charges brought against
      the conspirators are so inconsistent and improbable, that we give no
      credit whatever to them. If our readers think this scepticism
      unreasonable, let them turn to the contemporary accounts of the Popish
      plot. Let them look over the votes of Parliament, and the speeches of the
      king; the charges of Scroggs, and the harangues of the managers employed
      against Strafford. A person who should form his judgment from these pieces
      alone would believe that London was set on fire by the Papists, and that
      Sir Edmondbury Godfrey was murdered for his religion. Yet these stories
      are now altogether exploded. They have been abandoned by statesmen to
      aldermen, by aldermen to clergymen, by clergymen to old women, and by old
      women to Sir Harcourt Lees.

      Of the Latin historians, Tacitus was certainly the greatest. His style,
      indeed, is not only faulty in itself, but is, in some respects, peculiarly
      unfit for historical composition. He carries his love of effect far beyond
      the limits of moderation. He tells a fine story finely: but he cannot tell
      a plain story plainly. He stimulates till stimulants lose their power.
      Thucydides, as we have already observed, relates ordinary transactions
      with the unpretending clearness and succinctness of a gazette. His great
      powers of painting he reserves for events of which the slightest details
      are interesting. <span class="pagenum">407</span><a name="link407"
       id="link407"></a>The simplicity of the setting gives additional lustre to
      the brilliants. There are passages in the narrative of Tacitus superior to
      the best which can be quoted from Thucydides. But they are not enchased
      and relieved with the same skill. They are far more striking when
      extracted from the body of the work to which they belong than when they
      occur in their place, and are read in connection with what precedes and
      follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the delineation of character, Tacitus is unrivalled among historians,
      and has very few superiors among dramatists and novelists. By the
      delineation of character, we do not mean the practice of drawing up
      epigrammatic catalogues of good and had qualities, and appending them to
      the names of eminent men. No writer, indeed, has done this more skilfully
      than Tacitus; but this is not his peculiar glory. All the persons who
      occupy a large space in his works have an individuality of character which
      seems to pervade all their words and actions. We know them as if we had
      lived with them. Claudius, Nero, Otho, both the Agrippinas, are
      master-pieces. But Tiberius is a still higher miracle of art. The
      historian undertook to make us intimately acquainted with a man singularly
      dark and inscrutable,&mdash;with a man whose real disposition long
      remained swathed up in intricate folds of factitious virtues, and over
      whose actions the hypocrisy of his youth, and the seclusion of his old
      age, threw a singular my story. He was to exhibit the specious qualities
      of the tyrant in a light which might render them transparent, and enable
      us at once to perceive the covering and the vices which it concealed. He
      was to trace the gradations by which the first magistrate of a republic, a
      senator mingling freely in debate, a noble associating with his brother
      nobles, was transformed into an <span class="pagenum">408</span><a
      name="link408" id="link408"></a>Asiatic sultan; he was to exhibit a
      character, distinguished by courage, self-command, and profound policy,
      yet defiled by all
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent30">&ldquo;th&rsquo; extravagancy </span><br /> <span
      class="indent20">And crazy ribaldry of fancy.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to mark the gradual effect of advancing age and approaching death
      on this strange compound of strength and weakness; to exhibit the old
      sovereign of the world sinking into a dotage which, though it rendered his
      appetites eccentric, and his temper savage, never impaired the powers of
      his stern and penetrating mind&mdash;conscious of failing strength, raging
      with capricious sensuality, yet to the last the keenest of observers, the
      most artful of dissemblers, and the most terrible of masters. The task was
      one of extreme difficulty. The execution is almost perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talent which is required to write history thus bears a considerable
      affinity to the talent of a great dramatist. There is one obvious
      distinction. The dramatist creates; the historian only disposes. The
      difference is not in the mode of execution, but in the mode of
      conception.. Shakspeare is guided by a model which exists in his
      imagination; Tacitus, by a model furnished from without. Hamlet is to
      Tiberius what the Laocoon is to the Newton of Roubilliac.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this part of his art Tacitus certainly had neither equal nor second
      among the ancient historians. Herodotus, though he wrote in a dramatic
      form, had little of dramatic genius. The frequent dialogues which he
      introduces give vivacity and movement to the narrative, but are not
      strikingly characteristic. Xenophon is fond of telling his readers, at
      considerable length, what he thought of the persons whose adventures he
      relates. But he does not show them the men, and <span class="pagenum">409</span><a
      name="link409" id="link409"></a>enable them to judge for themselves. The
      heroes of Livy are the most insipid of all beings, real or imaginary, the
      heroes of Plutarch always excepted. Indeed, the manner of Plutarch in this
      respect reminds us of the cookery of those continental inns, the horror of
      English travellers, in which a certain nondescript broth is kept
      constantly boiling, and copiously poured, without distinction, over every
      dish as it comes up to table. Thucydides, though at a wide interval, comes
      next to Tacitus. His Pericles, his Nieias, his Cleon, his Brasidas, are
      happily discriminated. The lines are few, the colouring faint; but the
      general air and expression is caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      We begin, like the priest in Don Quixote&rsquo;s library, to be tired with
      taking down books one after another for separate judgment, and feel
      inclined to pass sentence on them in masses. We shall therefore, instead
      of pointing out the defects and merits of the different modern historians,
      state generally in what particulars they have surpassed their
      predecessors, and in what we conceive them to have failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have certainly been, in one sense, far more strict in their adherence
      to truth than most of the Greek and Roman writers. They do not think
      themselves entitled to render their narrative interesting by introducing
      descriptions, conversations, and harangues which have no existence but in
      their own imagination. This improvement was gradually introduced. History
      commenced among the modern nations of Europe, as it had commenced among
      the Greeks, in romance. Froissart was our Herodotus. Italy was to Europe
      what Athens was to Greece. In Italy, therefore, a more accurate and manly
      mode of narration was early introduced. Machiavelli and Guicciardini, in
      imitation <span class="pagenum">410</span><a name="link410"
       id="link410"></a>of Livy and Thucydides, composed speeches for their
      historical personages. But, as the classical enthusiasm which
      distinguished the age of Lorenzo and Leo gradually subsided, this absurd
      practice was abandoned. In France, we fear, it still, In some degree,
      keeps its ground. In our own country, a writer who should venture on it
      would be laughed to scorn. Whether the historians of the last two
      centuries tell more truth than those of antiquity, may perhaps be doubted.
      But it is quite certain that they tell fewer falsehoods.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the philosophy of history, the moderns have very far surpassed the
      ancients. It is not, indeed, strange that the Greeks and Romans should not
      have carried the science of government, or any other experimental science,
      so far as it has been carried in our time; for the experimental sciences
      are generally in a state of progression. They were better understood in
      the seventeenth century than in the sixteenth, and in the eighteenth
      century than in the seventeenth. But this constant improvement, this
      natural growth of knowledge, will not altogether account for the immense
      superiority of the modern writers. The difference is a difference not in
      degree but of kind. It is not merely that new principles have been
      discovered, but that new faculties seem to be exerted. It is not that at
      one time the human intellect should have made but small progress, and at
      another time have advanced far; but that at one time it should have been
      stationary, and at another time constantly proceeding. In taste and
      imagination, in the graces of style, in the arts of persuasion, in the
      magnificence of public works, the ancients were at least our equals. They
      reasoned as justly as ourselves on subjects which required pure
      demonstration. But in the moral sciences they made scarcely <span
      class="pagenum">411</span><a name="link411" id="link411"></a>any
      advance. During the long period which elapsed between the fifth century
      before the Christian era and the fifth century after it little perceptible
      progress was made. All the metaphysical discoveries of all the
      philosophers, from the time of Socrates to the northern invasion, are not
      to be compared in importance with those which have been made in England
      every fifty years since the time of Elizabeth. There is not the least
      reason to believe that the principles of government, legislation, and
      political economy, were better understood in the time of Augustus Cæsar
      than in the time of Pericles. In our own country, the sound doctrines of
      trade and jurisprudence have been, within the lifetime of a single
      generation, dimly hinted, boldly propounded, defended, systematised,
      adopted by all reflecting men of all parties, quoted in legislative
      assemblies, incorporated into laws and treaties.
    </p>
    <p>
      To what is this change to be attributed? Partly, no doubt, to the
      discovery of printing, a discovery which has not only diffused knowledge
      widely, but, as we have already observed, has also introduced into
      reasoning a precision unknown in those ancient communities, in which
      information was, for the most part, conveyed orally. There was, we
      suspect, another cause, less obvious, but still more powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of the two most famous nations of antiquity was remarkably
      exclusive. In the time of Homer the Greeks had not begun to consider
      themselves as a distinct race. They still looked with something of
      childish wonder and awe on the riches and wisdom of Sidon and Egypt. From
      what causes, and by what gradations, their feelings underwent a change, it
      is not easy to determine. Their history, from the Trojan to the Persian
      war, is covered with an obscurity broken <span class="pagenum">412</span><a
      name="link412" id="link412"></a>only by dim and scattered gleams of truth.
      But it is certain that a great alteration took place. They regarded
      themselves as a separate people. They had common religious rites, and
      common principles of public law, in which foreigners had no part. In all
      their political systems, monarchical, aristocratical, and demo-cratical,
      there was a strong family likeness. After the retreat of Xerxes and the
      fall of Mardonius, national pride rendered the separation between the
      Greeks and the barbarians complete. The conquerors considered themselves
      men of a superior breed, men who, in them intercourse with neighbouring
      nations, were to teach, and not to learn. They looked for nothing out of
      themselves. They borrowed nothing. They translated nothing. We cannot call
      to mind a single expression of any Greek writer earlier than the age of
      Augustus, indicating an opinion that anything worth reading could be
      written in any language except his own. The feelings which sprung from
      national glory were not altogether extinguished by national degradation.
      They were fondly cherished through ages of slavery and shame. The
      literature of Rome herself was regarded with contempt by those who had
      fled before her arms, and who bowed beneath her fasces. Voltaire says, in
      one of his six thousand pamphlets, that lu was the first person who told
      the French that England had produced eminent men besides the Duke of
      Marlborough. Down to a very late period, the Greeks seem to have stood in
      need of similar information with respect to their masters. With Paulus
      Æmilius, Sylla, and Cæsar they were well acquainted. But the notions which
      they entertained respecting Cicero and Virgil were, probably, not unlike
      those which Boileau may have formed about Shakspeare. Dionysius lived
      <span class="pagenum">413</span><a name="link413" id="link413"></a>in
      the most splendid age of Latin poetry and eloquence. He was a critic, and,
      after the manner of his age, an able critic. He studied the language of
      Rome, associated with its learned men, and compiled its history. Yet he
      seems to have thought its literature valuable only for the purpose of
      illustrating its antiquities. His reading appears to have been confined to
      its public records, and to a few old annalists. Once, and but once, if we
      remember rightly, he quotes Ennius, to solve a question of etymology. He
      has written much on the art of oratory: yet he has not mentioned the name
      of Cicero.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Romans submitted to the pretensions of a race which they despised.
      Their epic poet, while he claimed for them pre-eminence in the arts of
      government and war, acknowledged their inferiority in taste, eloquence,
      and science. Men of letters affected to understand the Greek language
      better than their own. Pomponius preferred the honour of becoming an
      Athenian, by intellectual naturalisation, to all the distinctions which
      were to be acquired in the political contests of Rome. His great friend
      composed Greek poems and memoirs. It is well known that Petrarch
      considered that beautiful language in which his sonnets are written, as a
      barbarous jargon, and intrusted his fame to those wretched Latin
      hexameters which, during the last four centuries, have scarcely found four
      readers. Many eminent Romans appear to have felt the same contempt for
      their native tongue as compared with the Greek. The prejudice continued to
      a very late period. Julian was as partial to the Greek language as
      Frederic the Great to the French: and it seems that he could not express
      himself with elegance in the dialect of the state which he ruled. <span
      class="pagenum">414</span><a name="link414" id="link414"></a>Even
      those Latin writers who did not carry this affectation so far looked on
      Greece as the only fount of knowledge. From Greece they derived the
      measures of their poetry, and, indeed, all of poetry that can be imported.
      From Greece they borrowed the principles and the vocabulary of their
      philosophy. To the literature of other nations they do not seem to have
      paid the slightest attention. The sacred books of the Hebrews, for
      example, books which, considered merely as human compositions, are
      invaluable to the critic, the antiquarian, and the philosopher, seem to
      have been utterly unnoticed by them. The peculiarities of Judaism, and the
      rapid growth of Christianity, attracted their notice. They made war
      against the Jews. They made laws against the Christians. But they never
      opened the books of Moses. Juvenal quotes the Pentateuch with censure. The
      author of the treatise on &ldquo;the Sublime&rdquo; quotes it with praise: but both of
      them quote it erroneously. When we consider what sublime poetry, what
      curious history, what striking and peculiar views of the Divine nature and
      of the social duties of men, are to be found in the Jewish scriptures,
      when we consider that two sects on which the attention of the government
      was constantly fixed appealed to those scriptures as the rule of their
      faith and practice, this indifference is astonishing. The fact seems to
      be, that the Greeks admired only themselves, and that the Romans admired
      only themselves and the Greeks. Literary men turned away with disgust from
      modes of thought and expression so widely different from all that they had
      been accustomed to admire. The effect was narrowness and sameness of
      thought. Their minds, if we may so express ourselves, bred in and in, and
      were accordingly cursed with barrenness <span class="pagenum">415</span><a
      name="link415" id="link415"></a>and degeneracy. No extraneous beauty or
      vigour was engrafted on the decaying stock. By an exclusive attention to
      one class of phenomena, by an exclusive taste for one species of
      excellence, the human intellect was stunted. Occasional coincidences were
      turned into general rules. Prejudices were confounded with instincts. On
      man, as he was found in a particular state of society&mdash;on government,
      as it had existed in a particular corner of the world, many just
      observations were made; but of man as man, or government as government,
      little was known. Philosophy remained stationary. Slight changes,
      sometimes for the worse and sometimes for the better, were made in the
      superstructure. But nobody thought of examining the foundations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast despotism of the Cæsars, gradually effacing all national
      peculiarities, and assimilating the remotest provinces of the empire to
      each other, augmented the evil. At the close of the third century after
      Christ, the prospects of mankind were fearfully dreary. A system of
      etiquette, as pompously frivolous as that of the Escurial, had been
      established. A sovereign almost invisible; a crowd of dignitaries minutely
      distinguished by badges and titles; rhetoricians who said nothing but what
      had been said ten thousand times; schools in &lsquo;which nothing was taught but
      what had been known for ages: such was the machinery provided for the
      government and instruction of the most enlightened part of the human race.
      That great community was then in danger of experiencing a calamity far
      more terrible than any of the quick, inflammatory, destroying maladies, to
      which nations are liable,&mdash;a tottering, drivelling, paralytic
      longevity, the immortality of the Struldbrugs, a Chinese civilisation. It
      would be easy to indicate many points of resemblance <span class="pagenum">416</span><a
      name="link416" id="link416"></a>between the subjects of Diocletian and the
      people of that Celestial Empire, where, during many centuries, nothing has
      been learned or unlearned: where government, where education, where the
      whole system of life, is a ceremony; where knowledge forgets to increase
      and multiply, and, like the talent buried in the earth, or the pound
      wrapped up in the napkin, experiences neither waste nor augmentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The torpor was broken by two great revolutions, the one moral, the other
      political, the one from within, the other from without. The victory of
      Christianity over Paganism, considered with relation to this subject only,
      was of great importance. It overthrew the old system of morals; and with
      it much of the old system of metaphysics. It furnished the orator with new
      topics of declamation, and the logician with new points of controversy.
      Above all, it introduced a new principle, of which the operation was
      constantly felt in every part of society. It stirred the stagnant mass
      from the inmost depths. It excited all the passions of a stormy democracy
      in the quiet and listless population of an overgrown empire. The fear of
      heresy did what the sense of oppression could not do; it changed men,
      accustomed to be turned over like sheep from tyrant to tyrant, into
      devoted partisans and obstinate rebels. The tones of an eloquence which
      had been silent for ages resounded from the pulpit of Gregory. A spirit
      which had been extinguished on the plains of Philippi revived in
      Athanasius and Ambrose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet even this remedy was not sufficiently violent for the disease. It did
      not prevent the empire of Constantinople from relapsing, after a short
      paroxysm of excitement, into a state of stupefaction, to which history
      furnishes scarcely any parallel. We there find that a <span class="pagenum">417</span><a
      name="link417" id="link417"></a>polished society, a society in which a
      most intricate and elaborate system of jurisprudence was established, in
      which the arts of luxury were well understood, in which the works of the
      great ancient writers were preserved and studied, existed for nearly a
      thousand years without making one great discovery in science, or producing
      one book which is read by any but curious inquirers. There were tumults,
      too, and controversies, and wars in abundance: and these things, bad as
      they are in themselves, have generally been favourable to the progress of
      the intellect. But here they tormented without stimulating. The waters
      were troubled; but no healing influence descended. The agitations
      resembled the grinnings and writhings of a galvanised corpse, not the
      struggles of an athletic man.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this miserable state the Western Empire was saved by the fiercest and
      most destroying visitation with which God has ever chastened his creatures&mdash;the
      invasion of the Northern nations. Such a cure was required for such a
      distemper. The fire of London, it has been observed, was a blessing. It
      burned down the city; but it burned out the plague. The same may be said
      of the tremendous devastation of the Roman dominions. It annihilated the
      noisome recesses in which lurked the seeds of great moral maladies; it
      cleared an atmosphere fatal to the health and vigour of the human mind. It
      cost Europe a thousand years of barbarianism to escape the fate of China.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the terrible purification was accomplished; and the second
      civilisation of mankind commenced, under circumstances which afforded a
      strong security that it would never retrograde and never pause. Europe was
      now a great federal community. Her numerous states were united by the easy
      ties of international law <span class="pagenum">418</span><a
      name="link418" id="link418"></a>and a common religion. Their institutions,
      their languages, their manners, their tastes in literature, their modes of
      education, were widely different. Their connection was close enough to
      allow of mutual observation and improvement, yet not so close as to
      destroy the idioms of national opinion and feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The balance of moral and intellectual influence thus established between
      the nations of Europe is far more important than the balance of political
      power. Indeed, we are inclined to think that the latter is valuable
      principally because it tends to maintain the former. The civilised world
      has thus been preserved from an uniformity of character fatal to all
      improvement. Every part of it has been illuminated with light reflected
      from every other. Competition has produced activity where monopoly would
      have produced sluggishness. The number of experiments in moral science
      which the speculator has an opportunity of witnessing has been increased
      beyond all calculation. Society and human nature, instead of being seen in
      a single point of view, are presented to him under ten thousand different
      aspects. By observing the manners of surrounding nations, by studying
      their literature, by comparing it with that of his own country and of the
      ancient republics, he is enabled to correct those errors into which the
      most acute men must fall when they reason from a single species to a
      genus. He learns to distinguish what is local from what is universal; what
      is transitory from what is eternal; to discriminate between exceptions and
      rules; to trace the operation of disturbing causes; to separate those
      general principles which are always true and everywhere applicable from
      the accidental circumstances with which, in every community, they are
      blended, and with which, in an isolated community, <span class="pagenum">419</span><a
      name="link419" id="link419"></a>they are confounded by the most
      philosophical mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence it is that, in generalisation, the writers of modern times have far
      surpassed those of antiquity. The historians of our own country are
      unequalled in depth and precision of reason; and, even in the works of our
      mere compilers, we often meet with speculations beyond the reach of
      Thucydides or Tacitus.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it must, at the same time, be admitted that they have characteristic
      faults, so closely connected with their characteristic merits, and of such
      magnitude, that it may well be doubted whether, on the whole, this
      department of literature has gained or lost during the last two-and-twenty
      centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best historians of later times have been seduced from truth, not by
      their imagination, but by their reason. They far excel their predecessors
      in the art of deducing general principles from facts. But unhappily they
      have fallen into the error of distorting facts to suit general principles.
      They arrive at a theory from looking at some of the phenomena; and the
      remaining phenomena they strain or curtail to suit the theory. For this
      purpose it is not necessary that they should assert what is absolutely
      false; for all questions in morals and politics are questions of
      comparison and degree. Any proposition which does not involve a
      contradiction in terms may by possibility be true; and, if all the
      circumstances which raise a probability in its favour be stated and
      enforced, and those which lead to an opposite conclusion be omitted or
      lightly passed over, it may appear to be demonstrated. In every human
      character and transaction there is a mixture of good and evil: a little
      exaggeration, a little suppression, a judicious use of epithets, a
      watchful and searching <span class="pagenum">420</span><a
      name="link420" id="link420"></a>scepticism with respect to the evidence on
      one side, a convenient credulity with respect to every report or tradition
      on the other, may easily make a saint of Laud, or a tyrant of Henry the
      Fourth.

      This species of misrepresentation abounds in the most valuable works of
      modern historians. Herodotus tells his story like a slovenly witness, who,
      heated by partialities and prejudices, unacquainted with the established
      rules of evidence, and uninstructed as to the obligations of his oath,
      confounds what he imagines with what he has seen and heard, and brings out
      facts, reports, conjectures, and fancies, in one mass. Hume is an
      accomplished advocate. Without positively asserting much more than he can
      prove, he gives prominence to all the circumstances which support his
      case; he glides lightly over those which are unfavourable to it; his own
      witnesses are applauded and encouraged; the statements which seem to throw
      discredit on them are controverted; the contradictions into which they
      fall are explained away; a clear and connected abstract of their evidence
      is given. Everything that is offered on the other side is scrutinised with
      the utmost severity; every suspicious circumstance is a ground for comment
      and invective; what cannot be denied is extenuated, or passed by without
      notice; concessions even are sometimes made: but this insidious candour
      only increases the effect of the vast mass of sophistry.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have mentioned Hume as the ablest and most popular writer of his class;
      but the charge which we have brought against him is one to which all our
      most distinguished historians are in some degree obnoxious. Gibbon, in
      particular, deserves very severe censure. Of all the numerous culprits,
      however, none is more deeply guilty than Mr. Mitford. We willingly
      acknowledge <span class="pagenum">421</span><a name="link421"
       id="link421"></a>the obligations which are due to his talents and
      industry. The modern historians of Greece had been in the habit of writing
      as if the world had learned nothing new during the last sixteen hundred
      years. Instead of illustrating the events which they narrated by the
      philosophy of a more enlightened age, they judged of antiquity by itself
      alone. They seemed to think that notions, long driven from every other
      corner of literature, had a prescriptive right to occupy this last
      fastness. They considered all the ancient historians as equally authentic.
      They scarcely made any distinction between him who related events at which
      he had himself been present and him who five hundred years after composed
      a philosophic romance for a society which had in the interval undergone a
      complete change. It was all Greek, and all true! The centuries which
      separated Plutarch from Thucydides seemed as nothing to men who lived in
      an age so remote. The distance of time produced an error similar to that
      which is sometimes produced by distance of place. There are many good
      ladies who think that all the people in India live together, and who
      charge a friend setting out for Calcutta with kind messages to Bombay. To
      Rollin and Barthelemi, in the same manner, all the classics were
      contemporaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mitford certainly introduced great improvements; he showed us that men
      who wrote in Greek and Latin sometimes told lies; he showed us that
      ancient history might be related in such a manner as to furnish not only
      allusions to school boys, but important lessons to statesmen. From that
      love of theatrical effect and high-flown sentiment which had poisoned
      almost every other work on the same subject his book is perfectly free.
      But his passion for a theory as false, and far <span class="pagenum">422</span><a
      name="link422" id="link422"></a>more ungenerous, led him substantially to
      violate truth in every page. Statements unfavourable to democracy are made
      with unhesitating confidence, and with the utmost bitterness of language.
      Every charge brought against a monarch or an aristocracy is sifted with
      the utmost care. If it cannot be denied, some palliating supposition is
      suggested; or we are at least reminded that some circumstances now unknown
      may have justified what at present appears unjustifiable. Two events are
      reported by the same author in the same sentence; their truth rests on the
      same testimony; but the one supports the darling hypothesis, and the other
      seems inconsistent with it. The one is taken and the other is left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practice of distorting narrative into a conformity with theory is a
      vice not so unfavourable as at first sight it may appear to the interests
      of political science. We have compared the writers who indulge in it to
      advocates; and we may add, that their conflicting fallacies, like those of
      advocates, correct each other. It has always been held, in the most
      enlightened nations, that a tribunal will decide a judicial question most
      fairly when it has heard two able men argue, as unfairly as possible, on
      the two opposite sides of it; and we are inclined to think that this
      opinion is just. Sometimes, it is true, superior eloquence and dexterity
      will make the worse appear the better reason; but it is at least certain
      that the judge will be compelled to contemplate the case under two
      different aspects. It is certain that no important consideration will
      altogether escape notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is at present the state of history. The poet laureate appears for the
      Church of England, Lingard for the Church of Rome. Brodie has moved to set
      <span class="pagenum">423</span><a name="link423" id="link423"></a>aside
      the verdicts obtained by Hume; and the cause in which Mitford succeeded
      is, we understand, about to be reheard. In the midst of these disputes,
      however, history proper, if we may use the term, is disappearing. The
      high, grave, impartial summing up of Thucydides is nowhere to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      While our historians are practising all the arts of controversy, they
      miserably neglect the art of narration, the art of interesting the
      affections and presenting pictures to the imagination. That a writer may
      produce these effects without violating truth is sufficiently proved by
      many excellent biographical works. The immense popularity which
      well-written books of this kind have acquired deserves the serious
      consideration of historians. Voltaire&rsquo;s Charles the Twelfth, Marmontel&rsquo;s
      Memoirs, Boswell&rsquo;s Life of Johnson, Southey&rsquo;s account of Nelson, are
      perused with delight by the most frivolous and indolent. Whenever any
      tolerable book of the same description makes its appearance, the
      circulating libraries are mobbed; the book societies are in commotion; the
      new novel lies uncut; the magazines and newspapers fill their columns with
      extracts. In the meantime histories of great empires, written by men of
      eminent ability, lie unread on the shelves of ostentatious libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writers of history seem to entertain an aristocratical contempt for
      the writers of memoirs. They think it beneath the dignity of men who
      describe the revolutions of nations to dwell on the details which
      constitute the charm of biography. They have imposed on themselves a code
      of conventional decencies as absurd as that which has been the banc of the
      French drama. The most characteristic and interesting circumstances are
      omitted or softened down, because, <span class="pagenum">424</span><a
      name="link424" id="link424"></a>as we are told, they are too trivial for
      the majesty of history. The majesty of history seems to resemble the
      majesty of the poor King of Spain, who died a martyr to ceremony because
      the proper dignitaries were not at hand to render him assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      That history would be more amusing if this etiquette were relaxed will, we
      suppose, be acknowledged. But would it be less dignified or less useful?
      What do we mean when we say that one past event is important and another
      insignificant? No past event has any intrinsic importance. The knowledge
      of it is valuable only as it leads us to form just calculations with
      respect to the future. A history which does not serve this purpose, though
      it may be filled with battles, treaties, and commotions, is as useless as
      the series of turnpike tickets collected by Sir Matthew Mite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us suppose that Lord Clarendon, instead of filling hundreds of folio
      pages with copies of state papers, in which the same assertions and
      contradictions are repeated till the reader is overpowered with weariness,
      had condescended to be the Boswell of the Long Parliament. Let us suppose
      that he had exhibited to us the wise and lofty self-government of Hampden,
      leading while he seemed to follow, and propounding unanswerable arguments
      in the strongest forms with the modest air of an inquirer anxious for
      information; the delusions which misled the noble spirit of Vane; the
      coarse fanaticism which concealed the yet loftier genius of Cromwell,
      destined to control a mutinous army and a factious people, to abase the
      flag of Holland, to arrest the victorious arms of Sweden, and to hold the
      balance firm between the rival monarchies of France and Spain. Let us
      suppose that he had made his Cavaliers and Roundheads talk in their own
      <span class="pagenum">425</span><a name="link425" id="link425"></a>style;
      that he had reported some of the ribaldry of Rupert&rsquo;s pages, and some of
      the cant of Harrison and Fleetwood. Would not his work in that ease have
      been more interesting? Would it not have been more accurate?
    </p>
    <p>
      A history in which every particular incident may be true may on the whole
      be false. The circumstances which have most influence on the happiness of
      mankind, the changes of manners and morals, the transition of communities
      from poverty to wealth, from knowledge to ignorance, from ferocity to
      humanity&mdash;these are, for the most part, noiseless revolutions. Their
      progress is rarely indicated by what historians are pleased to call
      important events. They are not achieved by armies, or enacted by senates.
      They are sanctioned by no treaties and recorded in no archives. They are
      carried on in every school, in every church, behind ten thousand counters,
      at ten thousand firesides. The upper current of society presents no
      certain criterion by which we can judge of the direction in which the
      under current flows. We read of defeats and victories. But we know that
      nations may be miserable amidst victories and prosperous amidst defeats.
      We read of the fall of wise ministers and of the rise of profligate
      favourites. But we must remember how small a proportion the good or evil
      effected by a single statesman can bear to the good or evil of a great
      social system.

      Bishop Watson compares a geologist to a gnat mounted on an elephant, and
      laying down theories as to the whole internal structure of the vast
      animal, from the phenomena of the hide. The comparison is unjust to the
      geologists; but it is very applicable to those historians who write as if
      the body politic were homogeneous, <span class="pagenum">426</span><a
      name="link426" id="link426"></a>who look only on the surface of affairs,
      and never think of the mighty and various organisation which lies deep
      below.

      In the works of such writers as these, England, at the close of the Seven
      Years&rsquo; War, is in the highest state of prosperity: at the close of the
      American war she is in a miserable and degraded condition; as if the
      people were not on the whole as rich, as well governed, and as well
      educated at the latter period as at the former. We have read books called
      Histories of England, under the reign of George the Second, in which the
      rise of Methodism is not even mentioned. A hundred years hence this breed
      of authors will, we hope, be extinct. If it should still exist, the late
      ministerial interregnum will be described in terms which will seem to
      imply that all government was at an end; that the social contract was
      annulled; and that the hand of every man was against his neighbour, until
      the wisdom and virtue of the new cabinet educed order out of the chaos of
      anarchy. We are quite certain that misconceptions as gross prevail at this
      moment respecting many important parts of our annals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of historical reading is analogous, In many respects, to that
      produced by foreign travel. The student, like the tourist, is transported
      into a new state of society. He sees new fashions. He hears new modes of
      expression. His mind is enlarged by contemplating the wide diversities of
      laws, of morals, and of manners. But men may travel far, and return with
      minds as contracted as if they had never stirred from their own
      market-town. In the same manner, men may know the dates of many battles
      and the genealogies of many royal houses, and yet be no wiser. Most people
      look at past times as princes look at foreign <span class="pagenum">427</span><a
      name="link427" id="link427"></a>countries. More than one illustrious
      stranger has landed on our island amidst the shouts of a mob, has dined
      with the king, has hinted with the master of the stag-hounds, has seen the
      guards reviewed, and a knight of the garter installed, has cantered along
      Regent Street, has visited St. Paul&rsquo;s, and noted down its dimensions; and
      has then departed, thinking that he has seen England. He has, in faet,
      seen a few public buildings, public men, and public ceremonies. But of the
      vast and complex system of society, of the fine shades of national
      charaeter, of the practical operation of government and laws, he knows
      nothing. He who would understand these things rightly must not confine his
      observations to palaces and solemn days. He must see ordinary men as they
      appear in their ordinary business and in their ordinary pleasures. He must
      mingle in the crowds of the exchange and the coffeehouse. He must obtain
      admittance to the convivial table and the domestic hearth. He must bear
      with vulgar expressions. He must not shrink from exploring even the
      retreats of misery. He who wishes to understand the condition of mankind
      in former ages must proceed on the same principle. If he attends only to
      public transactions, to wars, congresses, and debates, his studies will be
      as unprofitable as the travels of those imperial, royal, and serene
      sovereigns who form their judgment of our island from having gone in state
      to a few fine sights, and from having held formal conferences with a few
      great officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perfect historian is he in whose work the character and spirit of an
      age is exhibited in miniature. He relates no faet, he attributes no
      expression to his characters, which is not authenticated by sufficient
      testimony. But, by judicious selection, rejection, and arrangement, <span
      class="pagenum">428</span><a name="link428" id="link428"></a>he gives
      to truth those attractions which have been usurped by fiction. In his
      narrative a due subordination is observed: some transactions are
      prominent; others retire. But the scale on which he represents them is
      increased or diminished, not according to the dignity of the persons
      concerned in them, but according to the degree in which they elucidate the
      condition of society and the nature of man. He shows us the court, the
      camp, and the senate. But he shows ns also the nation. He considers no
      anecdote, no peculiarity of manner, no familiar saying, as too
      insignificant for his notice which is not too insignificant to illustrate
      the operation of laws, of religion, and of education, and to mark the
      progress of the human mind. Men will not merely be described, but will be
      made intimately known to us. The changes of manners will be indicated, not
      merely by a few general phrases or a few extracts from statistical
      documents, but by appropriate images presented in every line.
    </p>

      If a man, such as we are supposing, should write the history of England,
      he would assuredly not omit the battles, the sieges, the negotiations, the
      seditions, the ministerial changes. But with these he would intersperse
      the details which are the charm of historical romances. At Lincoln
      Cathedral there is a beautiful painted window, which was made by an
      apprentice out of the pieces of glass which had been rejected by his
      master. It is so far superior to every other in the church, that,
      according to the tradition, the vanquished artist killed himself from
      mortification. Sir Walter Scott, in the same manner, has used those
      fragments of truth which historians have scornfully thrown behind them in
      a manner which may well excite their envy. He has constructed out of their
      gleanings works which, <span class="pagenum">429</span><a
      name="link429" id="link429"></a>even considered as histories, are scarcely
      less valuable than their&rsquo;s. But a truly great historian would reclaim
      those materials which the novelist has appropriated. The history of the
      government, and the history of the people, would be exhibited in that mode
      in which alone they can be exhibited justly, in inseparable conjunction
      and intermixture. We should not then have to look for the wars of the
      Puritans in Clarendon, and for their phraseology in Old Mortality; for one
      half of King James in Hume, and for the other half in the Fortunes of
      Nigel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early part of our imaginary history would be rich witli colouring from
      romance, ballad, and chronicle. We should find ourselves in the company of
      knights such as those of Froissart, and of pilgrims such as those who rode
      witli Chaucer from the Tabard. Society would be shown from the highest to
      the lowest,&mdash;from the royal cloth of state to the den of the outlaw;
      from the throne of the legate, to the chimney-corner where the begging
      friar regaled himself. Palmers, minstrels, crusaders,&mdash;the stately
      monastery, with the good cheer in its refectory and the high-mass in its
      chapel,&mdash;the manor-house, witli its hunting and hawking,&mdash;the
      tournament, with the heralds and ladies, the trumpets and the cloth of
      gold,&mdash;would give truth and life to the representation. We should
      perceive, in a thousand slight touches, the importance of the privileged
      burgher, and the fierce and haughty spirit which swelled under the collar
      of the degraded villain. The revival of letters would not merely be
      described in a few magnificent periods. We should discern, in innumerable
      particulars, the fermentation of mind, the eager appetite for knowledge,
      which distinguished the sixteenth from the fifteenth century. In the
      Reformation <span class="pagenum">430</span><a name="link430"
       id="link430"></a>we should see, not merely a schism which changed the
      ecclesiastical constitution of England and the mutual relations of the
      European powers, but a moral war which raged in every family, which set
      the father against the son, and the son against the father, the mother
      against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother. Henry would be
      painted with the skill of Tacitus. We should have the change of his
      character from his profuse and joyous youth to his savage and imperious
      old age. We should perceive the gradual progress of selfish and tyrannical
      passions in a mind not naturally insensible or ungenerous; and to the last
      we should detect some remains of that open and noble temper which endeared
      him to a people whom he oppressed, struggling with the hardness of
      despotism and the irritability of disease. We should see Elizabeth in all
      her weakness and in all her strength, surrounded by the handsome
      favourites whom she never trusted, and the wise old statesmen whom she
      never dismissed, uniting in herself the most contradictory qualities of
      both her parents,&mdash;the coquetry, the caprice, the petty malice of
      Anne,&mdash;the haughty and resolute spirit of Henry. We have no
      hesitation in saying that a great artist might produce a portrait of this
      remarkable woman at least as striking as that in the novel of Kenilworth,
      without employing a single trait not authenticated by ample testimony. In
      the meantime, we should see arts cultivated, wealth accumulated, the
      conveniences of life improved. We should see the keeps, where nobles,
      insecure themselves, spread insecurity around them, gradually giving place
      to the halls of peaceful opulence, to the oriels of Longleat, and the
      stately pinnacles of Burleigh. We should see towns extended, deserts
      cultivated, the hamlets of fishermen <span class="pagenum">431</span><a
      name="link431" id="link431"></a>turned into wealthy havens, the meal of
      the peasant improved, and his but more commodiously furnished. We should
      see those opinions and feelings which produced the great struggle against
      the house of Stuart slowly growing up in the bosom of private families,
      before they manifested themselves in parliamentary debates. Then would
      come the civil war. Those skirmishes on which Clarendon dwells so minutely
      would be told, as Thucydides would have told them, with perspicuous
      conciseness. They are merely connecting links. But the great
      characteristics of the age, the loyal enthusiasm of the brave English
      gentry, the fierce licentiousness of the swearing, dicing, drunken
      reprobates, whose excesses disgrace the royal cause,&mdash;the austerity
      of the Presbyterian Sabbaths in the city, the extravagance of the
      independent preachers in the camp, the precise garb, the severe
      countenance, the petty scruples, the affected accent, the absurd names and
      phrases which marked the Puritans,&mdash;the valour, the policy, the
      public spirit, which lurked beneath these ungraceful disguises,&mdash;the
      dreams of the raving Fifth-monarchy-man, the dreams, scarcely less wild,
      of the philosophic republican,&mdash;all these would enter into the
      representation, and render it at once more exact and more striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instruction derived from history thus written would be of a vivid and
      practical character. It would be received by the imagination as well as by
      the reason. It would be not merely traced on the mind, but branded into
      it. Many truths, too, would be learned, which can be learned in no other
      manner. As the history of states is generally written, the greatest and
      most momentous revolutions seem to come upon them like supernatural
      inflictions, without warning <span class="pagenum">432</span><a
      name="link432" id="link432"></a>or cause. But the fact is, that such
      revolutions are almost always the consequences of moral changes, which
      have gradually passed on the mass of the community, and which ordinarily
      proceed far before their progress is indicated by any public measure. An
      intimate knowledge of the domestic history of nations is therefore
      absolutely necessary to the prognosis of political events. A narrative,
      defective in this respect, is as useless as a medical treatise which
      should pass by all the symptoms attendant on the early stage of a disease
      and mention only what occurs when the patient is beyond the reach of
      remedies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A historian, such as we have been attempting to describe, would indeed be
      an intellectual prodigy. In his mind, powers scarcely compatible with each
      other must be tempered into an exquisite harmony. We shall sooner see
      another Shakspeare or another Homer. The highest excellence to which any
      single faculty can be brought would be less surprising than such a happy
      and delicate combination of qualities. Yet the contemplation of imaginary
      models is not an unpleasant or useless employment of the mind. It cannot
      indeed produce perfection; but it produces improvement, and nourishes that
      generous and liberal fastidiousness which is not inconsistent with the
      strongest sensibility to merit, and which, while it exalts our conceptions
      of the art, does not render us unjust to the artist.

      its state of ideal perfection, is a compound of poetry and philosophy. It
      impresses general truths on the mind by a vivid representation of
      particular characters and incidents. But, in fact, the two hostile
      elements of which it consists have never been known to form a perfect
      amalgamation; and at length, in our own time, they have been completely
      and professedly separated. Good histories, in the proper sense of the
      word, we have not. But we have good historical romances, and good
      historical essays. The imagination and the reason, if we may use a legal
      metaphor, have made partition of a province of literature of which they
      were formerly seised <i>per my et per tout</i>; and now they hold their
      respective portions in severalty, instead of holding the whole in common.

      <span class="pagenum">434</span><a name="link434" id="link434"></a>manners,
      and garb, to show us over their houses, to scat us at their tables, to
      rummage their old-fashioned wardrobes, to explain the uses of their
      ponderous furniture, these parts of the duty which properly belongs to the
      historian have been appropriated by the historical novelist. On the other
      hand, to extract the philosophy of history, to direct our judgment of
      events and men, to trace the connection of causes and effects, and to draw
      from the occurrences of former times general lessons of moral and
      political wisdom, has become the business of a distinct class of writers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the two kinds of composition into which history has been thus divided,
      the one may be compared to a map, the other to a painted landscape. The
      picture, though it places the country before us, does not enable us to
      ascertain with accuracy the dimensions, the distances, and the angles. The
      map is not a work of imitative art. It presents no scene to the
      imagination; but it gives us exact information as to the bearings of the
      various points, and is a more useful companion to the traveller or the
      general than the painted landscape could be, though it were the grandest
      that ever Rosa peopled with outlaws, or the sweetest over which Claude
      ever poured the mellow effulgence of a setting sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is remarkable that the practice of separating the two ingredients of
      which history is composed has become prevalent on the Continent as well as
      in this country. Italy has already produced a historical novel, of high
      merit and of still higher promise. In France, the practice has been
      carried to a length somewhat whimsical. M. Sismondi publishes a grave and
      stately history of the Merovingian Kings, very valuable, and a little
      tedious. He then sends forth as a companion to <span class="pagenum">435</span><a
      name="link435" id="link435"></a>it a novel, in which he attempts to give a
      lively representation of characters and manners. This course, as it seems
      to us, has all the disadvantages of a division of labour, and none of its
      advantages. We understand the expediency of keeping the functions of cook
      and coachman distinct. The dinner will be better dressed, and the horses
      better managed. But where the two situations are united, as in the Maître
      Jacques of Molière, we do not see that the matter is much mended by the
      solemn form with which the pluralist passes from one of his employments to
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      We manage these things better in England. Sir Walter Scott gives us a
      novel; Mr. Hallam a critical and argumentative history. Both are occupied
      with the same matter. But the former looks at it with the eye of a
      sculptor. His intention is to give an express and lively image of its
      external form. The latter is an anatomist. His task is to dissect the
      subject to its inmost recesses, and to lay bare before us all the springs
      of motion and all the causes of decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hallam is, on the whole, far better qualified than any other writer of
      our time for the office which he has undertaken. He has great industry and
      great acuteness. His knowledge is extensive, various, and profound. His
      mind is equally distinguished by the amplitude of its grasp, and by the
      delicacy of its tact. His speculations have none of that vagueness which
      is the common fault of political philosophy. On the contrary, they are
      strikingly practical, and teach us not only the general rule, but the mode
      of applying it to solve particular cases. In this respect they often
      remind us of the Discourses of Machiavelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      The style is sometimes open to the charge of harshness. We have also here
      and there remarked a little <span class="pagenum">436</span><a
      name="link436" id="link436"></a>of that unpleasant trick, which Gibbon
      brought into fashion, the trick, we mean, of telling a story by
      implication and allusion. Mr. Hallam, however, has an excuse which Gibbon
      had not. His work is designed for readers who are already acquainted with
      the ordinary books on English history, and who can therefore unriddle
      these little enigmas without difficulty. The manner of the book is, on the
      whole, not unworthy of the matter. The language, even where most faulty,
      is weighty and massive, and indicates strong sense in every line. It often
      rises to an eloquence, not florid or impassioned, but high, grave, and
      sober; such as would become a state paper, or a judgment delivered by a
      great magistrate, a Somers or a D&rsquo;Agnessean.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this respect the character of Mr. Hallam&rsquo;s mind corresponds strikingly
      with that of his style. His work is eminently judicial. Its whole spirit
      is that of the bench, not that of the bar. He sums up with a calm, steady
      impartiality, turning neither to the right nor to the left, glossing over
      nothing, exaggerating nothing, while the advocates on both sides are
      alternately biting their lips to hear their conflicting misstatements and
      sophisms exposed. On a general survey, we do not scruple to pronounce the
      Constitutional History the most impartial book that we ever read. We think
      it the more incumbent on us to bear this testimony strongly at first
      setting out, because, in the course of our remarks, we shall think it
      right to dwell principally on those parts of it from which we dissent.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one peculiarity about Mr. Hallam which, while it adds to the
      value of his writings, will, we fear, take away something from their
      popularity. He is less of a worshipper than any historian whom we can
      <span class="pagenum">437</span><a name="link437" id="link437"></a>call
      to mind. Every political sect has its esoteric and its exoteric school,
      its abstract doctrines for the initiated, its visible symbols, its
      imposing forms, its mythological fables for the vulgar. It assists the
      devotion of those who are unable to raise themselves to the contemplation
      of pure truth by all the devices of Pagan or Papal superstition. It has
      its altars and its deified heroes, its relics and pilgrimages, its
      canonized martyrs and confessors, its festivals and its legendary
      miracles. Our pious ancestors, we are told, deserted the High * Altar of
      Canterbury, to lay all their obligations on the shrine of St. Thomas. In
      the same manner the great and comfortable doctrines of the Tory creed,
      those particularly which relate to restrictions on worship and on trade,
      are adored by squires and rectors in Pitt Clubs, under the name of a
      minister who was as bad a representative of the system which has been
      christened after him as Bechet of the spirit of the Gospel. On the other
      hand, the cause for which Hampden bled on the field and Sydney on the
      scaffold is enthusiastically toasted by many an honest radical who would
      be puzzled to explain the difference between Ship-money and the Habeas
      Corpus Act. It may be added that, as in religion, so in politics, few even
      of those who are enlightened enough to comprehend the meaning latent under
      the emblems of their faith can resist the contagion of the popular
      superstition. Often, when they flatter themselves that they are merely
      feigning a compliance with the prejudices of the vulgar, they are
      themselves under the influence of those very prejudices. It probably was
      not altogether on grounds of expediency that Socrates taught his followers
      to honour the gods whom the state honoured, and bequeathed a cock to
      Esculapius with his dying breath. So there is often <span class="pagenum">438</span><a
      name="link438" id="link438"></a>a portion of willing credulity and
      enthusiasm in the veneration which the most discerning men pay to their
      political idols. From the very nature of man it must be so. The faculty by
      which we inseparably associate ideas which have often been presented to us
      in conjunction is not under the absolute control of the will. It may be
      quickened into morbid activity. It may be reasoned into shamelessness. But
      in a certain decree it will always exist. The almost absolute mastery
      which Mr. Hallam has obtained over feelings of this class is perfectly
      astonishing to us, and will, we believe, be not only astonishing but
      offensive to many of his readers. It must particularly disgust those
      people who, in their speculations on politics, are not reasoners but
      fanciers; whose opinions, even when sincere, are not produced, according
      to the ordinary law of intellectual births, by induction or inference, but
      are equivocally generated by the heat of fervid tempers out of the
      overflowing of tumid imaginations. A man of this class is always in
      extremes. He cannot be a friend to liberty without calling for a community
      of goods, or a friend to order without taking under his protection the
      foulest excesses of tyranny. His admiration oscillates between the most
      worthless of rebels and the most worthless of oppressors, between Marten,
      the disgrace of the High Court of Justice, and Laud, the disgrace of the
      Star Chamber. He can forgive any thing but temperance and impartiality. He
      has a certain sympathy with the violence of his opponents, as well as with
      that of his associates. In every furious partisan he sees either his
      present self or his former self, the pensioner that is, or the Jacobin
      that has been. But he is unable to comprehend a writer who, steadily
      attached to principles, is indifferent about names and badges, and who
      judges <span class="pagenum">439</span><a name="link439" id="link439"></a>of
      characters with equable severity, not altogether untinctured with
      cynicism, but free from the slightest touch of passion, party spirit, or
      caprice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should probably like Mr. Hallam&rsquo;s book more if, instead of pointing out
      with strict fidelity the bright points and the dark spots of both parties,
      he had exerted himself to whitewash the one and to blacken the other. But
      we should certainly prize it far less. Eulogy and invective may be had for
      the asking. But for cold rigid justice, the one weight and the one
      measure, we know not where else we can look.
    </p>
    <p>
      No portion of our annals has been more perplexed and misrepresented by
      writers of different parties than the history of the Reformation. In this
      labyrinth of falsehood and sophistry, the guidance of Mr. Hallam is
      peculiarly valuable. It is impossible not to admire the even-handed
      justice with which he deals out castigation to right and left on the rival
      persecutors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is vehemently maintained by some writers of the present day that
      Elizabeth persecuted neither Papists nor Puritans as such, and that the
      severe measures which she occasionally adopted were dictated, not by
      religious intolerance, but by political necessity. Even the excellent
      account of those times which Mr. Hallam has given has not altogether
      imposed silence on the authors of this fallacy. The title of the Queen,
      they say, was annulled by the Pope; her throne was given to another; her
      subjects were incited to rebellion; her life was menaced; every Catholic
      was bound in conscience to be a traitor; it was therefore against
      traitors, not against Catholics, that the penal laws were enacted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order that our readers may be fully competent to appreciate the merits
      of this defence, we will state. <span class="pagenum">440</span><a
      name="link440" id="link440"></a>as concisely as possible, the substance of
      some of these laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Elizabeth ascended the throne, and before the least hostility
      to her government had been shown by the Catholic population, an act passed
      prohibiting the celebration of the rites of the Romish Church, on pain of
      forfeiture for the first offence, of a year&rsquo;s imprisonment for the second,
      and of perpetual imprisonment for the third.
    </p>
    <p>
      A law was next made in 1562, enacting, that all who had ever graduated at
      the Universities or received holy orders, all lawyers, and all
      magistrates, should take the oath of supremacy when tendered to them, on
      pain of forfeiture and imprisonment during the royal pleasure. After the
      lapse of three months, the oath might again be tendered to them; and, if
      it were again refused, the recusant was guilty of high treason. A
      prospective law, however severe, framed to exclude Catholics from the
      liberal professions, would have been mercy itself compared with this
      odious act. It is a retrospective statute; it is a retrospective penal
      statute; it is a retrospective penal statute against a large class. We
      will not positively affirm that a law of this description must always, and
      under all circumstances, be unjustifiable. But the presumption against it
      is most violent; nor do we remember any crisis, either in our own history,
      or in the history of any other country, which would have rendered such a
      provision necessary. In the present case, what circumstances called for
      extraordinary rigour? There might be disaffection among the Catholics. The
      prohibition of their worship would naturally produce it. But it is from
      their situation, not from their conduct, from the wrongs which they had
      suffered, not from those which they <span class="pagenum">441</span><a
      name="link441" id="link441"></a>had committed, that the existence of
      discontent among them must be inferred. There were libels, no doubt, and
      prophecies, and rumours, and suspicions, strange grounds for a law
      inflicting capital penalties, <i>ex post facto</i>, on a large body of
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight years later, the bull of Pius deposing Elizabeth produced a third
      law. This law, to which alone, as we conceive, the defence now under our
      consideration can apply, provides that, if any Catholic shall convert a
      Protestant to the Romish Church, they shall both suffer death as for high
      treason.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that we might safely content ourselves with stating the fact,
      and leaving it to the judgment of every plain Englishman. Recent
      controversies have, however, given so much importance to this subject,
      that we will offer a few remarks on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, the arguments which are urged in favour of Elizabeth
      apply with much greater force to the case of her sister Mary. The
      Catholics did not, at the time of Elizabeth&rsquo;s accession, rise in arms to
      seat a Pretender on her throne. But before Mary had given, or could give,
      provocation, the most distinguished Protestants attempted to set aside her
      rights in favour of the Lady Jane. That attempt, and the subsequent
      insurrection of Wyatt, furnished at least as good a plea for the burning
      of Protestants, as the conspiracies against Elizabeth furnish for the
      hanging and embowelling of Papists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is that both pleas are worthless alike. If such arguments are to
      pass current, it will be easy to prove that there was never such a thing
      as religious persecution since the creation. For there never was a
      religious persecution in which some odious crime was not, justly or
      unjustly, said to be obviously deducible <span class="pagenum">442</span><a
      name="link442" id="link442"></a>from the doctrines of the persecuted
      party. We might say that the Cæsars did not persecute the Christians; that
      they only punished men who were charged, rightly or wrongly, with burning
      Rome, and with committing the foulest abominations in secret assemblies;
      and that the refusal to throw frankincense on the altar of Jupiter was not
      the crime but only evidence of the crime. We might say, that the massacre
      of St. Bartholomew was intended to extirpate, not a religious sect, but a
      political party. For, beyond all doubt, the proceedings of the Huguenots,
      from the conspiracy of Amboise to the battle of Moncontour, had given much
      more trouble to the French monarchy than the Catholics have ever given to
      the English monarchy since the Reformation; and that too with much less
      excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The true distinction is perfectly obvious. To punish a man because he has
      committed a crime, or because he is believed, though unjustly, to have
      committed a crime, is not persecution. To punish a man, because we infer
      from the nature of some doctrine which he holds, or from the conduct of
      other persons who hold the same doctrines with him, that he will commit a
      crime, is persecution, and is, in every case, foolish and wicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Elizabeth put Ballard and Babington to death, she was not
      persecuting. Nor should we have accused her government of persecution for
      passing any law, however severe, against overt acts of sedition. But to
      argue that, because a man is a Catholic, he must think it right to murder
      a heretical sovereign, and that because he thinks it right he will attempt
      to do it, and then, to found on this conclusion a law for punishing him as
      if he had done it, is plain persecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, indeed, all men reasoned in the same manner on <span class="pagenum">443</span><a
      name="link443" id="link443"></a>the same data, and always did what they
      thought it their duty to do, this mode of dispensing punishment might be
      extremely judicious. But as people who agree about premises often disagree
      about conclusions, and as no man in the world acts up to his own standard
      of right, there are two enormous gaps in the logic by which alone
      penalties for opinions can be defended. The doctrine of reprobation, in
      the judgment of many very able men, follows by syllogistic necessity from
      the doctrine of election. Others conceive that the Antinomian heresy
      directly follows from the doctrine of reprobation; and it is very
      generally thought that licentiousness and cruelty of the worst description
      are likely to be the fruits, as they often have been the fruits, of
      Antinomian opinions. This chain of reasoning, we think, is as perfect in
      all its parts as that which makes out a Papist to be necessarily a
      traitor. Yet it would be rather a strong measure to hang all the
      Calvinists, on the ground that, if they were spared, they would infallibly
      commit all the atrocities of Matthias and Knipperdoling. For, reason the
      matter as we may, experience shows us that a man may believe in election
      without believing in reprobation, that he may believe in reprobation
      without being an Antinomian, and that he may be an Antinomian without
      being a bad citizen. Man, in short, is so inconsistent a creature that it
      is impossible to reason from his belief to his conduct, or from one part
      of his belief to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not believe that every Englishman who was reconciled to the Catholic
      Church would, as a necessary consequence, have thought himself justified
      in deposing or assassinating Elizabeth. It is not sufficient to say that
      the convert must have acknowledged the authority of the Pope, and that the
      Pope had issued a <span class="pagenum">444</span><a name="link444"
       id="link444"></a>bull against the Queen. We know through what strange
      loopholes the human mind contrives to escape, when it wishes to avoid a
      disagreeable inference from an admitted proposition. We know how long the
      Jansenists contrived to believe the Pope infallible in matters of
      doctrine, and at the same time to believe doctrines which he pronounced to
      be heretical. Let it pass, however, that every Catholic in the kingdom
      thought that Elizabeth might be lawfully murdered. Still the old maxim,
      that what is the business of everybody is the business of nobody, is
      particularly likely to hold good in a case in which a cruel death is the
      almost inevitable consequence of making any attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the ten thousand clergymen of the Church of England, there is scarcely
      one who would not say that a man who should leave his country and friends
      to preach the Gospel among savages, and who should, after labouring
      indefatigably without any hope of reward, terminate his life by martyrdom,
      would deserve the warmest admiration. Yet we doubt whether ten of the ten
      thousand ever thought of going on such an expedition. Why should we
      suppose that conscientious motives, feeble as they are constantly found to
      be in a good cause, should be omnipotent for evil? Doubtless there was
      many a jolly Popish priest in the old manor-houses of the northern
      counties, who would have admitted, in theory, the deposing power of the
      Pope, but who would not have been ambitious to be stretched on the rack,
      even though it were to be used, according to the benevolent proviso of
      Lord Burleigh, &ldquo;as charitably as such a thing can be,&rdquo; or to be hanged,
      drawn, and quartered, even though, by that rare indulgence which the
      Queen, of her special grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion, sometimes
      extended to very mitigated cases, he <span class="pagenum">445</span><a
      name="link445" id="link445"></a>were allowed a fair time to choke before
      the hangman began to grabble in his entrails.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the laws passed against the Puritans had not even the wretched excuse
      which we have been considering. In this case, the cruelty was equal, the
      danger infinitely less. In fact, the danger was created solely by the
      cruelty. But it is superfluous to press the argument. By no artifice of
      ingenuity can the stigma of persecution, the worst blemish of the English
      Church, be effaced or patched over. Her doctrines, we well know, do not
      tend to intolerance. She admits the possibility of salvation out of her
      own pale. But this circumstance, in itself honourable to her, aggravates
      the sin and the shame of those who persecuted in her name. Dominic and De
      Montfort did not, at least, murder and torture for differences of opinion
      which they considered as trifling. It was to stop an infection which, as
      they believed, hurried to certain perdition every soul which it seized,
      that they employed their fire and steel. The measures of the English
      government with respect to the Papists and Puritans sprang from a widely
      different principle. If those who deny that the founders of the Church
      were guilty of religious persecution mean only that the founders of the
      Church were not influenced by any religious motive, we perfectly agree
      with them. Neither the penal code of Elizabeth, nor the more hateful
      system by which Charles the Second attempted to force Episcopacy on the
      Scotch, had an origin so noble. The cause is to be sought in some
      circumstances which attended the Reformation in England, circumstances of
      which the effects long continued to be felt, and may in some degree be
      traced even at the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Germany, in France, in Switzerland, and in Scotland, <span
      class="pagenum">446</span><a name="link446" id="link446"></a>the
      contest against the Papal power was essentially a religions contest. In
      all those countries, indeed, the cause of the Reformation, like every
      other great cause, attracted to itself many supporters influenced by no
      conscientious principle, many who quitted the Established Church only
      because they thought her in danger, many who were weary of her restraints,
      and many who were greedy for her spoils. But it was not by these adherents
      that the separation was there conducted. They were welcome auxiliaries;
      their support was too often purchased by unworthy compliances; but,
      however exalted in rank or power, they were not the leaders in the
      enterprise. Men of a widely different description, men who redeemed great
      infirmities and errors by sincerity, disinterestedness, energy, and
      courage, men who, with many of the vices of revolutionary chiefs and of
      polemic divines, united some of the highest qualities of apostles, were
      the real directors. They might be violent in innovation and scurrilous in
      controversy. They might sometimes act with inexcusable severity towards
      opponents, and sometimes connive disreputably at the vices of powerful
      allies. But fear was not in them, nor hypocrisy, nor avarice, nor any
      petty selfishness. Their one great object was the demolition of the idols
      and the purification of the sanctuary. If they were too indulgent to the
      failings of eminent men from whose patronage they expected advantage to
      the church, they never flinched before persecuting tyrants and hostile
      armies. For that theological system to which they sacrificed the lives of
      others without scruple, they were ready to throw away their own lives
      without fear. Such were the authors of the great schism on the Continent
      and in the northern part of this island. The Elector of Saxony and the
      Landgrave of Hesse, the <span class="pagenum">447</span><a
      name="link447" id="link447"></a>Prince of Condé and the King of Navarre,
      the Earl of Moray and the Earl of Morton, might espouse the Protestant
      opinions, or might pretend to espouse them; but it was from Luther, from
      Calvin, from Knox, that the Reformation took its character.
    </p>
    <p>
      England has no such names to show: not that she wanted men of sincere
      piety, of deep learning, of steady and adventurous courage. But these were
      thrown into the back ground. Elsewhere men of this character were the
      principals. Here they acted a secondary part. Elsewhere worldliness was
      the tool of zeal. Here zeal was the tool of worldliness. A King, whose
      character may be best described by saying that he was despotism itself
      personified, unprincipled ministers, a rapacious aristocracy, a servile
      Parliament, such were the instruments by which England was delivered from
      the yoke of Rome. The work which had been begun by Henry, the murderer of
      his wives, was continued by Somerset, the murderer of his brother, and
      completed by Elizabeth, the murderer of her guest. Sprung from brutal
      passion, nurtured by selfish policy, the Reformation in England displayed
      little of what had, in other countries, distinguished it, unflinching and
      unsparing devotion, boldness of speech, and singleness of eye. These were
      indeed to be found; but it was in the lower ranks of the party which
      opposed the authority of Rome, in such men as Hooper, Latimer, Rogers, and
      Taylor. Of those who had any important share in bringing the Reformation
      about, Ridley was perhaps the only person who did not consider it as a
      mere political job. Even Ridley did not play a very prominent part. Among
      the statesmen and prelates who principally gave the tone to the religious
      changes, there is one, and one only, whose conduct partiality <span
      class="pagenum">448</span><a name="link448" id="link448"></a>itself
      can attribute to any other than interested motives. It is not strange,
      therefore, that his character should have been the subject of fierce
      controversy. We need not say that we speak of Cranmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hallam has been severely censured for saying, with his usual placid
      severity, that, &ldquo;if we weigh the character of this prelate in an equal
      balance, he will appear far indeed removed from the turpitude imputed to
      him by his enemies; yet not entitled to any extraordinary veneration.&rdquo; We
      will venture to expand the sense of Mr. Hallam, and to comment on it thus:&mdash;If
      we consider Cranmer merely as a statesman, he will not appear a much worse
      man than Wolsey, Gardiner, Cromwell, or Somerset. But, when an attempt is
      made to set him up as a saint, it is scarcely possible for any man of
      sense who knows the history of the times to preserve his gravity. If the
      memory of the archbishop had been left to find its own place, he would
      have soon been lost among the crowd which is mingled
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent25">&ldquo;A quel cattivo coro </span><br /> <span
      class="indent20">Degli angeli, che non furon ribelli, </span><br /> <span
      class="indent20">Nè fur fedcli a Dio, nia per se foro.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And the only notice which it would have been necessary to take of his name
      would have been
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent15">&ldquo;Non ragioniam di lui; ma guarda, e passa.&rdquo;
       </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But, since his admirers challenge for him a place in the noble army of
      martyrs, his claims require fuller discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The origin of his greatness, common enough in the scandalous chronicles of
      courts, seems strangely out of place in a hagiology. Cranmer rose into
      favour by serving Henry in the disgraceful affair of his first divorce. He
      promoted the marriage of Anne <span class="pagenum">449</span><a
      name="link449" id="link449"></a>Boleyn with the King. On a frivolous
      pretence he pronounced that marriage null and void. On a pretence, if
      possible, still more frivolous, he dissolved the ties which bound the
      shameless tyrant to Anne of Cleves. He attached himself to Cromwell while
      the fortunes of Cromwell flourished. He voted for cutting off Cromwell&rsquo;s
      head without a trial, when the tide of royal favour turned. He conformed
      backwards and forwards as the King changed his mind. He assisted, while
      Henry lived, in condemning to the flames those who denied the doctrine of
      transubstantiation. He found out, as soon as Henry was dead, that the
      doctrine was false. He was, however, not at a loss for people to burn. The
      authority of his station and of his grey hairs was employed to overcome
      the disgust with which an intelligent and virtuous child regarded
      persecution. Intolerance is always bad. But the sanguinary intolerance of
      a man who thus wavered in his creed excites a loathing, to which it is
      difficult to give vent without calling foul names. Equally false to
      political and to religious obligations, the primate was first the tool of
      Somerset, and then the tool of Northumberland. When the Protector wished
      to put his own brother to death, without even the semblance of a trial, he
      found a ready instrument in Cranmer. In spite of the canon law, which
      forbade a churchman to take any part in matters of blood, the archbishop
      signed the warrant for the atrocious sentence. When Somerset had been in
      his turn destroyed, his destroyer received the support of Cranmer in a
      wicked attempt to change the course of the succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apology made for him by his admirers only renders his conduct more
      contemptible. He complied, it is said, against his better judgment,
      because he could <span class="pagenum">450</span><a name="link450"
       id="link450"></a>not resist the entreaties of Edward. A holy prelate of
      sixty, one would think, might be better employed by the bedside of a dying
      child, than in committing crimes at the request of the young disciple. If
      Cranmer had shown half as much firmness when Edward requested him to
      commit treason as he had before shown when Edward requested him not to
      commit murder, he might have saved the country from one of the greatest
      misfortunes that it ever underwent. He became, from whatever motive, the
      accomplice of the worthless Dudley. The virtuous scruples of another young
      and amiable mind were to be overcome. As Edward had been forced into
      persecution, Jane was to be seduced into treason. No transaction in our
      annals is more unjustifiable than this. If a hereditary title were to be
      respected, Mary possessed it. If a parliamentary title were preferable,
      Mary possessed that also. If the interest of the Protestant religion
      required a departure from the ordinary rule of succession, that interest
      would have been best served by raising Elizabeth to the throne. If the
      foreign relations of the kingdom were considered, still stronger reasons
      might be found for preferring Elizabeth to Jane. There was great doubt
      whether Jane or the Queen of Scotland had the better claim; and that doubt
      would, in all probability, have produced a war both with Scotland and with
      France, if the project of Northumberland had not been blasted in its
      infancy. That Elizabeth had a better claim than the Queen of Scotland was
      indisputable. To the part which Cranmer, and unfortunately some better men
      than Cranmer, took in this most reprehensible scheme, much of the severity
      with which the Protestants were afterwards treated must in fairness be
      ascribed. <span class="pagenum">451</span><a name="link451"
       id="link451"></a>The plot failed; Popery triumphed; and Cranmer recanted.
      Most people look on his recantation as a single blemish on an honourable
      life, the frailty of an unguarded moment. But, in fact, his recantation
      was in strict accordance with the system on which he had constantly acted.
      It was part of a regular habit. It was not the first recantation that he
      had made; and, in all probability, if it had answered its purpose, it
      would not have been the last. We do not blame him for not choosing to be
      burned alive. It is no very severe reproach to any person that he does not
      possess heroic fortitude. But surely a man who liked the fire so little
      should have had some sympathy for others. A persecutor who inflicts
      nothing which he is not ready to endure deserves some respect. But when a
      man who loves his doctrines more than the lives of his neighbours loves
      his own little finger better than his doctrines, a very simple argument <i>a
      fortiori</i> will enable us to estimate the amount of his benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his martyrdom, it is said, redeemed every thing. It is extraordinary
      that so much ignorance should exist on this subject. The fact is that, if
      a martyr be a man who chooses to die rather than to renounce his opinions,
      Cranmer was no more a martyr than Dr. Dodd. He died, solely because he
      could not help it. He never retracted his recantation till he found he had
      made it in vain. The Queen was fully resolved that, Catholic or
      Protestant, he should burn. Then he spoke out, as people generally speak
      out when they are at the point of death and have nothing to hope or to
      fear on earth. If Mary had suffered him to live, we suspect that he would
      have heard mass and received absolution, like a good Catholic, till the
      accession of Elizabeth, and that he would then have purchased, by <span
      class="pagenum">452</span><a name="link452" id="link452"></a>another
      apostasy, the power of burning men better and braver than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not mean, however, to represent him as a monster of wickedness. He
      was not wantonly cruel or treacherous. He was merely a supple, timid,
      interested courtier, in times of frequent and violent change. That which
      has always been represented as his distinguishing virtue, the facility
      with which he forgave his enemies, belongs to the character. Slaves of his
      class are never vindictive, and never grateful. A present interest effaces
      past services and past injuries from their minds together. Their only
      object is self-preservation; and for this they conciliate those who wrong
      them, just as they abandon those who serve them. Before we extol a man for
      his forgiving temper, we should inquire whether he is above revenge, or
      below it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somerset had as little principle as his coadjutor. Of Henry, an orthodox
      Catholic, except that he chose to be his own Pope, and of Elizabeth, who
      certainly had no objection to the theology of Rome, we need say nothing.
      These four persons were the great authors of the English Reformation.
      Three of them had a direct interest in the extension of the royal
      prerogative. The fourth was the ready tool of any who could frighten him.
      It is not difficult to see from what motives, and on what plan, such
      persons would be inclined to remodel the Church. The scheme was merely to
      transfer the full cup of sorceries from the Babylonian enchantress to
      other hands, spilling as little as possible by the way. The Catholic
      doctrines and rites were to be retained in the Church of England. But the
      King was to exercise the control which had formerly belonged to the Roman
      Pontiff. In this <span class="pagenum">453</span><a name="link453"
       id="link453"></a>Henry for a time succeeded. The extraordinary force of
      his character, the fortunate situation in which he stood with respect to
      foreign powers, and the vast resources which the suppression of the
      monasteries placed at his disposal, enabled him to oppress both the
      religious factions equally. He punished with impartial severity those who
      renounced the doctrines of Rome, and those who acknowledged her
      jurisdiction. The basis, however, on which he attempted to establish his
      power was too narrow to be durable. It would have been impossible even for
      him long to persecute both persuasions. Even under his reign there had
      been insurrections on the part of the Catholics, and signs of a spirit
      which was likely soon to produce insurrection on the part of the
      Protestants. It was plainly necessary, therefore, that the Crown should
      form an alliance with one or with the other side. To recognise the Papal
      supremacy, would have been to abandon the whole design. Reluctantly and
      sullenly the government at last joined the Protestants. In forming this
      junction, its object was to procure as much aid as possible for its
      selfish undertaking, and to make the smallest possible concessions to the
      spirit of religious innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this compromise the Church of England sprang. In many respects,
      indeed, it has been well for her that, in an age of exuberant zeal, her
      principal founders were mere politicians. To this circumstance she owes
      her moderate articles, her decent ceremonies, her noble and pathetic
      liturgy. Her worship is not disfigured by mummery. Yet she has preserved,
      in a far greater degree than any of her Protestant sisters, that art of
      striking the senses and filling the imagination in which the Catholic
      Church so eminently excels. But, on the <span class="pagenum">454</span><a
      name="link454" id="link454"></a>other hand, she continued, to be, for more
      than a hundred and fifty years, the servile handmaid of monarchy, the
      steady enemy of public liberty. The divine right of kings, and the duty of
      passively obeying all their commands, were her favourite tenets. She held
      those tenets firmly through times of oppression, persecution, and
      licentiousness; while law was trampled down; while judgment was perverted;
      while the people were eaten as though they were bread. Once, and but once,
      for a moment, and but for a moment, when her own dignity and property were
      touched, she forgot to practise the submission which she had taught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth clearly discerned the advantages which were to be derived from a
      close connection between the monarchy and the priesthood. At the time of
      her accession, indeed, she evidently meditated a partial reconciliation
      with Rome; and, throughout her whole life, she leaned strongly to some of
      the most obnoxious parts of the Catholic system. But her imperious temper,
      her keen sagacity, and her peculiar situation, soon led her to attach
      herself completely to a church which was all her own. On the same
      principle on which she joined it, she attempted to drive all her people
      within its pale by persecution. She supported it by severe penal laws, not
      because she thought conformity to its discipline necessary to salvation;
      but because it was the fastness which arbitrary power was making strong
      for itself; because she expected a more profound obedience from those who
      saw in her both their civil and their ecclesiastical chief, than from
      those who, like the Papists, ascribe spiritual authority to the Pope, or
      from those who, like some of the Puritans, ascribed it only to Heaven. To
      dissent from her establishment was to dissent from an institution founded
      with <span class="pagenum">455</span><a name="link455" id="link455"></a>an
      express view to the maintenance and extension of the royal prerogative.
    </p>
    <p>
      This great Queen and her successors, by considering conformity and loyalty
      as identical, at length made them so. With respect to the Catholics,
      indeed, the rigour of persecution abated after her death. James soon found
      that they were unable to injure him, and that the animosity which the
      Puritan party felt towards them drove them of necessity to take refuge
      under his throne. During the subsequent conflict, their fault was anything
      but disloyalty. On the other hand, James hated the Puritans with more than
      the hatred of Elizabeth. Her aversion to them was political; his was
      personal. The sect had plagued him in Scotland, where he was weak; and he
      was determined to be even with them in England, where he was powerful.
      Persecution gradually changed a sect into a faction. That there was
      anything in the religious opinions of the Puritans which rendered them
      hostile to monarchy has never been proved to our satisfaction. After our
      civil contests, it became the fashion to say that Presbyterianism was
      connected with Republicanism; just as it has been the fashion to say,
      since the time of the French Revolution, that Infidelity is connected with
      Republicanism. It is perfectly true that a church, constituted on the
      Calvinistic model, will not strengthen the hands of the sovereign so much
      as a hierarchy which consists of several ranks, differing in dignity and
      emolument, and of which all the members are constantly looking to the
      government for promotion. But experience has clearly shown that a
      Calvinistic church, like every other church, is disaffected when it is
      persecuted, quiet when it is tolerated, and actively loyal when it is
      favoured and cherished. Scotland has had a Presbyterian <span
      class="pagenum">456</span><a name="link456" id="link456"></a>establishment
      during a century and a half. Yet her General Assembly has not, during that
      period, given half so much trouble to the government as the Convocation of
      the Church of England gave during the thirty years which followed the
      Revolution. That James and Charles should have been mistaken in this point
      is not surprising. But we are astonished, we must confess, that men of our
      own time, men who have before them the proof of what toleration can
      effect, men who may see with their own eyes that the Presbyterians are no
      such monsters when government is wise enough to let them alone, should
      defend the persecutions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as
      indispensable to the safety of the church and the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      How persecution protects churches and thrones was soon made manifest. A
      systematic political opposition, vehement, daring, and inflexible, sprang
      from a schism about trifles, altogether unconnected with the real
      interests of religion or of the state. Before the close of the reign of
      Elizabeth this opposition began to show itself It broke forth on the
      question of the monopolies. Even the imperial Lioness was compelled to
      abandon her prey, and slowly and fiercely to recede before the assailants.
      The spirit of liberty grew with the growing wealth and intelligence of the
      people. The feeble struggles and insults of James irritated instead of
      suppressing it; and the events which immediately followed the accession of
      his son portended a contest of no common severity, between a king resolved
      to be absolute, and a people resolved to be free.
    </p>
    <p>
      The famous proceedings of the third Parliament of Charles, and the
      tyrannical measures which followed its dissolution, are extremely well
      described by Mr. Hal-lam. No writer, we think, has shown, in so clear and
      <span class="pagenum">457</span><a name="link457" id="link457"></a>satisfactory
      a manner, that the Government then entertained a fixed purpose of
      destroying the old parliamentary constitution of England, or at least of
      reducing it to a mere shadow. We hasten, however, to a part of his work
      which, though it abounds in valuable information and in remarks well
      deserving to be attentively considered, and though it is, like the rest,
      evidently written in a spirit of perfect impartiality, appears to us, in
      many points, objectionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      We pass to the year 1640. The fate of the short Parliament held in that
      year clearly indicated the views of the King. That a parliament so
      moderate in feeling should have met after so many years of oppression is
      truly wonderful. Hyde extols its loyal and conciliatory spirit. Its
      conduct, we are told, made the excellent Falkland in love with the very
      name of Parliament. We think, indeed, with Oliver St. John, that its
      moderation was carried too far, and that the times required sharper and
      more decided councils. It was fortunate, however, that the King had
      another opportunity of showing that hatred of the liberties of his
      subjects which was the ruling principle of all his conduct. The sole crime
      of the Commons was that, meeting after a long intermission of parliaments,
      and after a long series of cruelties and illegal imposts, they seemed
      inclined to examine grievances before they would vote supplies. For this
      insolence they were dissolved almost as soon as they met.
    </p>
    <p>
      Defeat, universal agitation, financial embarrassments, disorganization in
      every part of the government, compelled Charles again to convene the
      Houses before the close of the same year. Their meeting was one of the
      great eras in the history of the civilised world. Whatever of political
      freedom exists either in Europe or in <span class="pagenum">458</span><a
      name="link458" id="link458"></a>America, has sprung, directly or
      indirectly, from those institutions which they secured and reformed. We
      never turn to the annals of those times without feeling increased
      admiration of the patriotism, the energy, the decision, the consummate
      wisdom, which marked the measures of that great Parliament, from the day
      on which it met to the commencement of civil hostilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impeachment of Strafford was the first, and perhaps the greatest blow.
      The whole conduct of that celebrated man proved that he had formed a
      deliberate scheme to subvert the fundamental laws of England. Those parts
      of his correspondence which have been brought to light since his death
      place the matter beyond a doubt. One of his admirers has, indeed, offered
      to show &ldquo;that the passages which Mr. Hallam has invidiously extracted from
      the correspondence between Laud and Strafford, as proving their design to
      introduce a thorough tyranny, refer not to any such design, but to a
      thorough reform in the affairs of state, and the thorough maintenance of
      just authority.&rdquo; We will recommend two or three of these passages to the
      especial notice of our readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      All who know anything of those times, know that the conduct of Hampden in
      the affair of the ship-money met with the warm approbation of every
      respectable Royalist in England. It drew forth the ardent eulogies of the
      champions of the prerogative and even of the Crown lawyers themselves.
      Clarendon allows Hampden&rsquo;s demeanour through the whole proceeding to have
      been such, that even those who watched for an occasion against the
      defender of the people, were compelled to acknowledge themselves unable to
      find any fault in him. That he was right in the point of law is now
      universally admitted. Even <span class="pagenum">459</span><a
      name="link459" id="link459"></a>had it been otherwise, he had a fair case.
      Five of the Judges, servile as our Courts then were, pronounced in his
      favour. The majority against him was the smallest possible. In no country
      retaining the slightest vestige of constitutional liberty can a modest and
      decent appeal to the laws be treated as a crime. Stratford, however,
      recommends that, for taking the sense of a legal tribunal on a legal
      question, Hampden should be punished, and punished severely, &ldquo;whipt,&rdquo; says
      the insolent apostate, &ldquo;whipt into his senses. If the rod,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;be
      so used that it smarts not, I am the more sorry.&rdquo; This is the maintenance
      of just authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      In civilised nations, the most arbitrary governments have generally
      suffered justice to have a free course in private suits. Strafford wished
      to make every cause in every court subject to the royal prerogative. He
      complained that in Ireland he was not permitted to meddle in cases between
      party and party. &ldquo;I know very well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that the common lawyers
      will be passionately against it, who are wont to put such a prejudice upon
      all other professions, as if none were to be trusted, or capable to
      administer justice, but themselves; yet how well this suits with monarchy,
      when they monopolise all to be governed by their yearbooks, you in England
      have a costly example.&rdquo; We are really curious to know by what arguments it
      is to be proved, that the power of interfering in the lawsuits of
      individuals is part of the just authority of the executive government.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not strange that a man so careless of the common civil rights, which
      even despots have generally respected, should treat with scorn the
      limitations which the constitution imposes on the royal prerogative. We
      might quote pages: but we will content ourselves with <span class="pagenum">460</span><a
      name="link460" id="link460"></a>a single specimen:&mdash;&ldquo;The debts of the
      Crown being taken off, you may govern as you please: and most resolute I
      am that may be done without borrowing any help forth of the King&rsquo;s
      lodgings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the theory of that thorough reform in the state which Strafford
      meditated. His whole practice, from the day on which he sold himself to
      the court, was in strict conformity to his theory. For his accomplices
      various excuses may be urged, ignorance, imbecility, religious bigotry.
      But Wentworth had no such plea. His intellect was capacious. His early
      prepossessions were on the side of popular rights. He knew the whole
      beauty and value of the system which he attempted to deface. He was the
      first of the Rats, the first of those statesmen whose patriotism has been
      only the coquetry of political prostitution, and whose profligacy has
      taught governments to adopt the old maxim of the slave-market, that it is
      cheaper to buy than to breed, to import defenders from an Opposition than
      to rear them in a Ministry. He was the first Englishman to whom a peerage
      was a sacrament of infamy, a baptism into the communion of corruption. As
      he was the earliest of the hateful list, so was he also by far the
      greatest; eloquent, sagacious, adventurous, intrepid, ready of invention,
      immutable of purpose, in every talent which exalts or destroys nations
      preeminent, the lost Archangel, the Satan of the apostasy. The title for
      which, at the time of his desertion, he exchanged a name honourably
      distinguished in the cause of the people, reminds us of the appellation
      which, from the moment of the first treason, fixed itself on the fallen
      Son of the Morning,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent20">Satan;&mdash;so call him now.&mdash;His
      former name </span><br /> <span class="indent20">Is heard no more in
      heaven."= <span class="pagenum">461</span><a name="link461"
       id="link461"></a>The defection of Strafford from the popular party
      contributed mainly to draw on him the hatred of his contemporaries. It has
      since made him an object of peculiar interest to those whose lives have
      been spent, like his, in proving that there is no malice like the malice
      of a renegade. Nothing can be more natural or becoming than that one
      turncoat should eulogize another. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Many enemies of public liberty have been distinguished by their private
      virtues. But Strafford was the same throughout. As was the statesman, such
      was the kinsman, and such the lover. His conduct towards Lord Mountmorris
      is recorded by Clarendon. For a word which can scarcely be called rash,
      which could not have been made the subject of an ordinary civil action,
      the Lord Lieutenant dragged a man of high rank, married to a relative of
      that saint about whom he whimpered to the Peers, before a tribunal of
      slaves. Sentence of death was passed. Every thing but death was inflicted.
      Yet the treatment which Lord Ely experienced was still more scandalous.
      That nobleman was thrown into prison, in order to compel him to settle his
      estate in a manner agreeable to his daughter-in-law, whom, as there is
      every reason to believe, Strafford had debauched. These stories do not
      rest on vague report. The historians most partial to the minister admit
      their truth, and censure them in terms which, though too lenient for the
      occasion, are still severe. These facts are alone sufficient to justify
      the appellation with which Pym branded him, &ldquo;the wicked Earl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of all Strafford&rsquo;s vices, in spite of all his dangerous projects,
      he was certainly entitled to the benefit of the law; but of the law in all
      its rigour; of <span class="pagenum">462</span><a name="link462"
       id="link462"></a>the law according to the utmost strictness of the letter,
      which killeth. He was not to be torn in pieces by a mob, or stabbed in the
      back by an assassin. He was not to have punishment meted out to him from
      his own iniquitous measure. But if justice, in the whole range of its wide
      armoury, contained one weapon which could pierce him, that weapon his
      pursuers were bound, before God and man, to employ.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <span class="indent25">&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;If he may </span><br /> <span
      class="indent20">Find mercy in the law, &rsquo;tis his: if none, </span><br />
      <span class="indent20">Let him not seek&rsquo;t of us.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the language which the Commons might o o o justly use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did then the articles against Strafford strictly amount to high treason?
      Many people, who know neither what the articles were, nor what high
      treason is, will answer in the negative, simply because the accused
      person, speaking for his life, took that ground of defence. The Journals
      of the Lords show that the Judges were consulted. They answered, with one
      accord, that the articles on which the Earl was convicted, amounted to
      high treason. This judicial opinion, even if we suppose it to have been
      erroneous, goes far to justify the Parliament. The judgment pronounced in
      the Exchequer Chamber has always been urged by the apologists of Charles
      in defence of his conduct respecting ship-money. Yet on that occasion
      there was but a bare majority in favour of the party at whose pleasure all
      the magistrates composing the tribunal were removable. The decision in the
      case of Strafford was unanimous; as far as we can judge, it was unbiassed;
      and, though there may be room for hesitation, we think on the whole that
      it was reasonable. &ldquo;It may be remarked,&rdquo; says Mr. Hallam, &ldquo;that the
      fifteenth article <span class="pagenum">463</span><a name="link463"
       id="link463"></a>of the impeachment, charging Strafford with raising money
      by his own authority, and quartering troops on the people of Ireland, in
      order to compel their obedience to his unlawful requisitions, upon which,
      and upon one other article, not upon the whole matter, the Peers voted him
      guilty, does, at least, approach very nearly, if we may not say more, to a
      substantive treason within the statute of Edward the Third, as a levying
      of war against the king.&rdquo; This most sound and just exposition has provoked
      a very ridiculous reply. &ldquo;It should seem to be an Irish construction
      this,&rdquo; says an assailant of Mr. Hallam, &ldquo;which makes the raising money for
      the King&rsquo;s service, with his knowledge, and by his approbation, to come
      under the head of levying war on the King, and therefore to be high
      treason.&rdquo; Now, people who undertake to write on points of constitutional
      law should know, what every attorney&rsquo;s clerk and every forward schoolboy
      on an upper form knows, that, by a fundamental maxim of our polity, the
      King can do no wrong; that every court is bound to suppose his conduct and
      his sentiments to be, on every occasion, such as they ought to be; and
      that no evidence can be received for the purpose of setting aside this
      loyal and salutary presumption. The Lords, therefore, were bound to take
      it for granted that the King considered arms which were unlawfully
      directed against his people as directed against his own throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remarks of Mr. Hallam on the bill of attainder, though, as usual,
      weighty and acute, do not perfectly satisfy us. He defends the principle,
      but objects to the severity of the punishment. That, on great emergencies,
      the State may justifiably pass a retrospective act against an offender, we
      have no doubt whatever. We are acquainted with only one argument on the
      other side, <span class="pagenum">464</span><a name="link464"
       id="link464"></a>which lias in it enough of reason to hear an answer.
      Warning, it is said, is the end of punishment. But a punishment inflicted,
      not by a general rule, but by an arbitrary discretion, cannot serve the
      purpose of a warning. It is therefore useless; and useless pain ought not
      to be inflicted. This sophism has found its way into several books on
      penal legislation. It admits, however, of a very simple refutation. In the
      first place, punishments <i>ex post facto</i> are not altogether useless
      even as warnings. They are warnings to a particular class which stand in
      great need of warnings, to favourites and ministers. They remind persons
      of this description that there may be a day of reckoning for those who
      ruin and enslave their country in all the forms of law. But this is not
      all. Warning is, in ordinary cases, the principal end of punishment; but
      it is not the only end. To remove the offender, to preserve society from
      those dangers which are to be apprehended from his incorrigible depravity
      is often one of the ends. In the case of such a knave as Wild, or such a
      ruffian as Thurtell, it is a very important end. In the case of a powerful
      and wicked statesman, it is infinitely more important; so important, as
      alone to justify the utmost severity, even though it were certain that his
      fate would not deter others from imitating his example. At present,
      indeed, we should think it extremely pernicious to take such a course,
      even with a worse minister than Strafford, if a worse could exist; for, at
      present, Parliament has only to withhold its support from a Cabinet to
      produce an immediate change of hands. The case was widely different in the
      reign of Charles the First. That Prince had governed during eleven years
      without any Parliament; and, even when Parliament was sitting, had
      supported Buckingham against its most violent remonstrances. <span
      class="pagenum">465</span><a name="link465" id="link465"></a>Mr.
      Hallam is of opinion that a bill of pains and penalties ought to have been
      passed; but he draws a distinction less just, we think, than his
      distinctions usually are. His opinion, so far as we can collect it, is
      this, that there are almost insurmountable objections to retrospective
      laws for capital punishment, but that, where the punishment stops short of
      death, the objections are comparatively trifling. Now the practice of
      taking the severity of the penalty into consideration, when the question
      is about the mode of procedure and the rules of evidence, is no doubt
      sufficiently common. We often see a man convicted of a simple larceny on
      evidence on which he would not be convicted of a burglary. It sometimes
      happens that a jury, when there is strong suspicion, but not absolute
      demonstration, that an act, unquestionably amounting to murder, was
      committed by the prisoner before them, will find him guilty of
      manslaughter. But this is surely very irrational. The rules of evidence no
      more depend on the magnitude of the interests at stake than the rules of
      arithmetic. We might as well say that we have a greater chance of throwing
      a size when we are playing for a penny than when we are playing for a
      thousand pounds, as that a form of trial which is sufficient for the
      purposes of justice, in a matter affecting liberty and property, is
      insufficient in a matter affecting life. Nay, if a mode of proceeding be
      too lax for capital cases, it is, <i>à fortiori</i>, too lax for all
      others; for, in capital cases, the principles of human nature will always
      afford considerable security. No judge is so cruel as he who indemnifies
      himself for scrupulosity in cases of blood, by license in affairs of
      smaller importance. The difference in tale on the one side far more than
      makes up for the difference in weight on the other. <span class="pagenum">466</span><a
      name="link466" id="link466"></a>If there be any universal objection to
      retrospective punishment, there is no more to be said. But such is not the
      opinion of Mr. Hallam. He approves of the mode of proceeding. He thinks
      that a punishment, not previously affixed by law to the offences of
      Strafford, should have been inflicted; that Strafford should have been, by
      act of Parliament, degraded from his rank, and condemned to perpetual
      banishment. Our difficulty would have been at the first step, and there
      only. Indeed we can scarcely conceive that any case which does not call
      for capital punishment can call for punishment by a retrospective act. We
      can scarcely conceive a man so wicked and so dangerous that the whole
      course of law must be disturbed in order to reach him, yet not so wicked
      as to deserve the severest sentence, nor so dangerous as to require the
      last and surest custody, that of the grave. If we had thought that
      Strafford might be safely suffered to live in France, we should have
      thought it better that he should continue to live in England, than that he
      should be exiled by a special act. As to degradation, it was not the Earl,
      but the general and the statesman, whom the people had to fear. Essex
      said, on that occasion, with more truth than elegance, &ldquo;Stone dead hath no
      fellow.&rdquo; And often during the civil wars the Parliament had reason to
      rejoice that an irreversible law and an impassable barrier protected them
      from the valour and capacity of Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is remarkable that neither Hyde nor Falkland voted against the bill of
      attainder. There is, indeed, reason to believe that Falkland spoke in
      favour of it. In one respect, as Mr. Hallam has observed, the proceeding
      was honourably distinguished from others of the same kind. An act was
      passed to relieve the children <span class="pagenum">467</span><a
      name="link467" id="link467"></a>of Strafford from the forfeiture and
      corruption of blood which were the legal consequences of the sentence. The
      Crown had never shown equal generosity in a case of treason. The liberal
      conduct of the Commons has been fully and most appropriately repaid. The
      House of Wentworth has since that time been as much distinguished by
      public spirit as by power and splendour, and may at the present moment
      boast of members with whom Say and Hampden would have been proud to act.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is somewhat curious that the admirers of Strafford should also be,
      without a single exception, the admirers of Charles; for, whatever we may
      think of the conduct of the Parliament towards the unhappy favourite,
      there can be no doubt that the treatment which he received from his master
      was disgraceful. Faithless alike to his people and to his tools, the King
      did not scruple to play the part of the cowardly approver, who hangs his
      accomplice. It is good that there should be such men as Charles in every
      league of villany. It is for such men that the offer of pardon and reward
      which appears after a murder is intended. They are indemnified,
      remunerated, and despised. The very magistrate who avails himself of their
      assistance looks on them as more contemptible than the criminal whom they
      betray. Was Strafford innocent? Was he a meritorious servant of the Crown?
      If so, what shall we think of the Prince, who having solemnly promised him
      that not a hair of his head should be hurt, and possessing an unquestioned
      constitutional right to save him, gave him up to the vengeance of his
      enemies? There were some points which we know that Charles would not
      concede, and for which he was willing to risk the chances of civil war.
      Ought o <span class="pagenum">468</span><a name="link468" id="link468"></a>not
      a King, who will make a stand for any thing, to make a stand for the
      innocent blood? Was Strafford guilty? Even on this supposition, it is
      difficult not to feel disdain for the partner of his guilt, the tempter
      turned punisher. If, indeed, from that time forth, the conduct of Charles
      had been blameless, it might have been said that his eyes were at last
      opened to the errors of his former conduct, and that, in sacrificing to
      the wishes of his Parliament a minister whose crime had been a devotion
      too zealous to the interests of his prerogative, he gave a painful and
      deeply humiliating proof of the sincerity of his repentance. We may
      describe the King&rsquo;s behaviour on this occasion in terms resembling those
      which Hume has employed when speaking of the conduct of Churchill at the
      Revolution. It required ever after the most rigid justice and sincerity in
      the dealings of Charles with his people to vindicate his conduct towards
      his friend. His subsequent dealings with his people, however, clearly
      showed, that it was not from any respect for the Constitution, or from any
      sense of the deep criminality of the plans in which Strafford and himself
      had been engaged, that he gave up his minister to the axe. It became
      evident that he had abandoned a servant who, deeply guilty as to all
      others, was guiltless to him alone, solely in order to gain time for
      maturing other schemes of tyranny, and purchasing the aid of other
      Wentworths. He, who would not avail himself of the power which the laws
      gave him to save an adherent to whom his honour was pledged, soon showed
      that he did not scruple to break every law and forfeit every pledge, in
      order to work the ruin of his opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put not your trust in princes!&rdquo; was the expression of the fallen
      minister, when he heard that Charles <span class="pagenum">469</span><a
      name="link469" id="link469"></a>had consented to his death. The whole
      history of the times is a sermon on that bitter text. The defence of the
      Long Parliament is comprised in the dying words of its victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early measures of that Parliament Mr. Hallam in general approves. But
      he considers the proceedings which took place after the recess in the
      summer of 1641 as mischievous and violent. He thinks that, from that time,
      the demands of the Houses were not warranted by any imminent danger to the
      Constitution, and that in the war which ensued they were clearly the
      aggressors. As this is one of the most interesting questions in our
      history, we will venture to state, at some length, the reasons which have
      led us to form an opinion on it contrary to that of a writer whose
      judgment we so highly respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will premise that we think worse of King Charles the First than even
      Mr. Hallam appears to do. The fixed hatred of liberty which was the
      principle of the King&rsquo;s public conduct, the unscrupulousness with which he
      adopted any means which might enable him to attain his ends, the readiness
      with which he gave promises, the impudence with which he broke them, the
      cruel indifference with which he threw away his useless or damaged tools,
      made him, at least till his character was fully exposed and his power
      shaken to its foundations, a more dangerous enemy to the Constitution than
      a man of far greater talents and resolution might have been. Such princes
      may still be seen, the scandals of the southern thrones of Europe, princes
      false alike to the accomplices who have served them and to the opponents
      who have spared them, princes who, in the hour of danger, concede every
      thing, swear every thing, hold out their cheeks to every smiter, give
      <span class="pagenum">470</span><a name="link470" id="link470"></a>up
      to punishment every instrument of their tyranny, and await with meek and
      smiling implacability the blessed day of perjury and revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will pass by the instances of oppression and falsehood which disgraced
      the early part of the reign of Charles. We will leave out of the question
      the whole history of his third Parliament, the price which he exacted for
      assenting to the Petition of Right, the perfidy with which he violated his
      engagements, the death of Eliot, the barbarous punishments inflicted by
      the Star-Chamber, the ship-money, and all the measures now universally
      condemned, which disgraced his administration from 1630 to 1640. We will
      admit that it might be the duty of the Parliament, after punishing the
      most guilty of his creatures, after abolishing the inquisitorial tribunals
      which had been the instruments of his tyranny, after reversing the unjust
      sentences of his victims, to pause in its course. The concessions which
      had been made were great, the evils of civil war obvious, the advantages
      even of victory doubtful. The former errors of the King might be imputed
      to youth, to the pressure of circumstances, to the influence of evil
      counsel, to the undefined state of the law. We firmly believe that if,
      even at this eleventh hour, Charles had acted fairly towards his people,
      if he had even acted fairly towards his own partisans, the House of
      Commons would have given him a fair chance of retrieving the public
      confidence. Such was the opinion of Clarendon. He distinctly states that
      the fury of opposition had abated, that a reaction had begun to take
      place, that the majority of those who had taken part against the King were
      desirous of an honourable and complete reconciliation, and that the more
      violent, or, as it soon appeared, the more judicious members of <span
      class="pagenum">471</span><a name="link471" id="link471"></a>the
      popular party were fast declining in credit. The Remonstrance had been
      carried with great difficulty. The uncompromising antagonists of the
      court, such as Cromwell, had begun to talk of selling their estates and
      leaving England. The event soon showed, that they were the only men who
      really understood how much inhumanity and fraud lay hid under the
      constitutional language and gracious demeanour of the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attempt to seize the five members was undoubtedly the real cause of
      the war. From that moment, the loyal confidence with which most of the
      popular party were beginning to regard the King was turned into hatred and
      incurable suspicion. From that moment, the Parliament was compelled to
      surround itself with defensive arms. From that moment, the city assumed
      the appearance of a garrison. From that moment, in the phrase of
      Clarendon, the carriage of Hampden became fiercer, that he drew the sword
      and threw away the scabbard. For, from that moment, it must have been
      evident to every impartial observer that, in the midst of professions,
      oaths, and smiles, the tyrant was constantly looking forward to an
      absolute sway and to a bloody revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advocates of Charles have very dexterously contrived to conceal from
      their readers the real nature of this transaction. By making concessions
      apparently candid and ample, they elude the great accusation. They allow
      that the measure was weak and even frantic, an absurd caprice of Lord
      Digby, absurdly adopted by the King. And thus they save their client from
      the full penalty of his transgression, by entering a plea of guilty to the
      minor offence. To us his conduct appears at this day as at the time it
      appeared to the Parliament and the city. We think it by no means so
      foolish <span class="pagenum">472</span><a name="link472" id="link472"></a>as
      it pleases his friends to represent it, and far more wicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, the transaction was illegal from beginning to end. The
      impeachment was illegal. The process was illegal. The service was illegal.
      If Charles wished to prosecute the five members for treason, a hill
      against them should have been sent to a grand jury. That a commoner cannot
      be tried for high treason by the Lords, at the suit of the Crown, is part
      of the very alphabet of our law. That no man can be arrested by the King
      in person is equally clear. This was an established maxim of our
      jurisprudence even in the time of Edward the Fourth. &ldquo;A subject,&rdquo; said
      Chief Justice Markham to that Prince, &ldquo;may arrest for treason: the King
      cannot; for, if the arrest be illegal, the party has no remedy against the
      King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The time at which Charles took this step also deserves consideration. We
      have already said that the ardour which the Parliament had displayed at
      the time of its first meeting had considerably abated, that the leading
      opponents of the court were desponding, and that their followers were in
      general inclined to milder and more temper» measures than those which had
      hitherto been pursued. In every country, and in none more than in England,
      there is a disposition to take the part of those who are unmercifully run
      down and who seem destitute of all means of defence. Every man who has
      observed the ebb and flow of public feeling in our own time will easily
      recall examples to illustrate this remark. An English statesman ought to
      pay assiduous worship to Nemesis, to be most apprehensive of ruin when he
      is at the height of power and popularity, and to dread his enemy most when
      most completely prostrated. The fate of the Coalition Ministry in 1784
      <span class="pagenum">473</span><a name="link473" id="link473"></a>is
      perhaps the strongest instance in our history of the operation of this
      principle. A few weeks turned the ablest and most extended Ministry that
      ever existed into a feeble Opposition, and raised a King who was talking
      of retiring to Hanover to a height of power which none of his predecessors
      had enjoyed since the Revolution. A crisis of this description was
      evidently approaching in 1642. At such a crisis, a Prince of a really
      honest and generous nature, who had erred, who had seen his error, who had
      regretted the lost affections of his people, who rejoiced in the dawning
      hope of regaining them, would be peculiarly careful to take no step which
      could give occasion of offence, even to the unreasonable. On the other
      hand, a tyrant, whose whole life was a lie, who hated the Constitution the
      more because he had been compelled to feign respect for it, and to whom
      his own honour and the love of his people were as nothing, would select
      such a crisis for some appalling violation of law, for some stroke which
      might remove the chiefs of an Opposition, and intimidate the herd. This
      Charles attempted. He missed his blow; but so narrowly, that it would have
      been mere madness in those at whom it was aimed to trust him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It deserves to be remarked that the King had, a short time before,
      promised the most respectable Royalists in the House of Commons, Falkland,
      Colepepper, and Hyde, that he would take no measure in which that House
      was concerned, without consulting them. On this occasion he did not
      consult them. His conduct astonished them more than any other members of
      the assembly. Clarendon says that they were deeply hurt by this want of
      confidence, and the more hurt, because, if they had been consulted, they
      would have <span class="pagenum">474</span><a name="link474"
       id="link474"></a>done their utmost to dissuade Charles from so improper a
      proceeding. Did it never occur to Clarendon, will it not at least occur to
      men less partial, that there was good reason for this? When the danger to
      the throne seemed imminent, the King was ready to put himself for a time
      into the hands of those who, though they disapproved of his past conduct,
      thought that the remedies had now become worse than the distempers. But we
      believe that In his heart he regarded both the parties in the Parliament
      with feelings of aversion which differed only in the degree of their
      intensity, and that the awful warning which he proposed to give, by
      immolating the principal supporters of the Remonstrance, was partly
      intended for the instruction of those who had concurred in censuring the
      ship-money and in abolishing the Star-Chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commons informed the King that their members should be forthcoming to
      answer any charge legally brought against them. The Lords refused to
      assume the unconstitutional office with which he attempted to invest them.
      And what was then his conduct? He went, attended by hundreds of armed men,
      to seize the objects of his hatred in the House itself. The party opposed
      to him more than insinuated that his purpose was of the most atrocious
      kind. We will not condemn him merely on their suspicions. We will not hold
      him answerable for the sanguinary expressions of the loose brawlers who
      composed his train. We will judge of his act by itself alone. And we say,
      without hesitation, that it is impossible to acquit him of having
      meditated violence, and violence which might probably end in blood. He
      knew that the legality of his proceedings was denied. He must have known
      that some of the accused members were men not likely to submit <span
      class="pagenum">475</span><a name="link475" id="link475"></a>peaceably
      to an illegal arrest. There was every îeason to expect that he would find
      them in their places, that they would refuse to obey his summons, and that
      the House would support them in their refusal. What course would then have
      been left to him? Unless we suppose that he went on this expedition for
      the sole purpose of making himself ridiculous, we must believe that he
      would have had recourse to force. There would have been a scuffle; and it
      might not, under such circumstances, have been in his power, even if it
      had been in his inclination, to prevent a scuffle from ending in a
      massacre. Fortunately for his fame, unfortunately perhaps for what he
      prized far more, the interests of his hatred and his ambition, the affair
      ended differently. The birds, as he said, were flown, and his plan was
      disconcerted. Posterity is not extreme to mark abortive crimes; and thus
      the King&rsquo;s advocates have found it easy to represent a step which, but for
      a trivial accident, might have filled England with mourning and dismay, as
      a mere error of judgment, wild and foolish, but perfectly innocent. Such
      was not, however, at the time, the opinion of any party. The most zealous
      Royalists were so much disgusted and ashamed that they suspended their
      opposition to the popular party, and, silently at least, concurred in
      measures of precaution so strong as almost to amount to resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day, whatever of confidence and loyal attachment had survived
      the misrule of seventeen years was, in the great body of the people,
      extinguished, and extinguished for ever. As soon as the outrage had
      failed, the hypocrisy recommenced. Down to the very eve of this flagitious
      attempt, Charles had been talking of his respect for the privileges of
      Parliament <span class="pagenum">476</span><a name="link476"
       id="link476"></a>and the liberties of his people. He began again in the
      same style on the morrow; but it was too late. To trust him now would have
      been, not moderation, but insanity. What common security would suffice
      against a Prince who was evidently watching his season with that cold and
      patient hatred which, in the long run, tires out every other passion?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is certainly from no admiration of Charles that Mr. Hallam disapproves
      of the conduct of the Houses in resorting to arms. But he thinks that any
      attempt on the part of that Prince to establish a despotism would have
      been as strongly opposed by his adherents as by his enemies, and that
      therefore the Constitution might be considered as out of danger, or, at
      least, that it had more to apprehend from the war than from the King. On
      this subject Mr. Hallam dilates at length, and with conspicuous ability.
      We will offer a few considerations which lead us to incline to a different
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Constitution of England was only one of a large family. In all the
      monarchies of Western Europe, during the middle ages, there existed
      restraints on the royal authority, fundamental laws, and representative
      assemblies. In the fifteenth century, the government of Castile seems to
      have been as free as that of our own country. That of Arragon was beyond
      all question more so. In France, the sovereign was more absolute. Yet,
      even in France, the States-General alone could constitutionally impose
      taxes; and, at the very time when the authority of those assemblies was
      beginning to languish, the Parliament of Paris received such an accession
      of strength as enabled it, in some measure, to perform the functions of a
      legislative assembly. Sweden and Denmark had constitutions of a similar
      description. <span class="pagenum">477</span><a name="link477"
       id="link477"></a>Let us overleap two or three hundred years, and
      contemplate Europe at the commencement of the eighteenth century. Every
      free constitution, save one, had gone down. That of England had weathered
      the danger, and was riding in full security. In Denmark and Sweden, the
      kings had availed themselves of the disputes which raged between the
      nobles and the commons, to unite all the powers of government in their own
      hands. In France the institution of the States was only mentioned by
      lawyers as a part of the ancient theory of their government. It slept a
      deep sleep, destined to be broken by a tremendous waking. No person
      remembered the sittings of the three orders, or expected ever to see them
      renewed. Louis the Fourteenth had imposed on his parliament a patient
      silence of sixty years. His grandson, after the War of the Spanish
      Succession, assimilated the constitution of Arragon to that of Castile,
      and extinguished the last feeble remains of liberty in the Peninsula. In
      England, on the other hand, the Parliament was infinitely more powerful
      than it had ever been. Not only was its legislative authority fully
      established; but its right to interfere, by advice almost equivalent to
      command, in every department of the executive government, was recognised.
      The appointment of ministers, the relations with foreign powers, the
      conduct of a war or a negotiation, depended less on the pleasure of the
      Prince than on that of the two Houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      What then made us to differ? Why was it that, in that epidemic malady of
      constitutions, ours escaped the destroying influence; or rather that, at
      the very crisis of the disease, a favourable turn took place in England,
      and in England alone? It was not surely without a cause that so many
      kindred systems of government, <span class="pagenum">478</span><a
      name="link478" id="link478"></a>having flourished together so long,
      languished and expired at almost the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the fashion to say, that the progress of civilisation is favourable
      to liberty. The maxim, though in some sense true, must be limited by many
      qualifications and exceptions. Wherever a poor and rude nation, in which
      the form of government is a limited monarchy, receives a great accession
      of wealth and knowledge, it is in imminent danger of falling under
      arbitrary power.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such a state of society as that which existed all over Europe during
      the middle ages, very slight checks sufficed to keep the sovereign in
      order. His means of corruption and intimidation were very scanty. He had
      little money, little patronage, no military establishment. His armies
      resembled juries. They were drawn out of the mass of the people: they soon
      returned to it again: and the character which was habitual, prevailed over
      that which was occasional. A campaign of forty days was too short, the
      discipline of a national militia too lax, to efface from their minds the
      feelings of civil life. As they carried to the camp the sentiments and
      interests of the farm and the shop, so they carried back to the farm and
      the shop the military accomplishments which they had acquired in the camp.
      At home the soldier learned how to value his rights, abroad how to defend
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a military force as this was a far stronger restraint on the regal
      power than any legislative assembly. The army, now the most formidable
      instrument of the executive power, was then the most formidable check on
      that power. Resistance to an established government, in modern times so
      difficult and perilous an enterprise, was, in the fourteenth and fifteenth
      centuries, <span class="pagenum">479</span><a name="link479"
       id="link479"></a>the simplest and easiest matter in the world. Indeed, it
      was far too simple and easy. An insurrection was got up then almost as
      easily as a petition is got up now. In a popular cause, or even in an
      unpopular cause favoured by a few great nobles, a force of ten thousand
      armed men was raised in a week. If the King were, like our Edward the
      Second and Richard the Second, generally odious, he could not procure a
      bow or halbert. He fell at once and without an effort. In such times a
      sovereign like Louis the Fifteenth or the Emperor Paul, would have been
      pulled down before his misgovernment had lasted for a month. We find that
      all the fame and influence of our Edward the Third could not save his
      Madame de Pompadour from the effects of the public hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hume and many other writers have hastily concluded that, in the fifteenth
      century, the English Parliament was altogether servile, because it
      recognised, without opposition, every successful usurper. That it was not
      servile its conduct on many occasions of inferior importance is sufficient
      to prove. But surely it was not strange that the majority of the nobles,
      and of the deputies chosen by the commons, should approve of revolutions
      which the nobles and commons had effected. The Parliament did not blindly
      follow the event of war, but participated in those changes of public
      sentiment on which the event of war depended. The legal check was
      secondary and auxiliary to that which the nation held in its own hands.
      There have always been monarchies in Asia, in which the royal authority
      has been tempered by fundamental laws, though no legislative body exists
      to watch over them. The guarantee is the opinion of a community of which
      every individual is a soldier. Thus, the king of Cabul, <span
      class="pagenum">480</span><a name="link480" id="link480"></a>as Mr.
      Elplunstone informs us, cannot augment the land revenue, or interfere with
      the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the European kingdoms of this description there were representative
      assemblies. But it was not necessary, that those assemblies should meet
      very frequently, that they should interfere with all the operations of the
      executive government, that they should watch with jealousy, and resent
      with prompt indignation, every violation of the laws which the sovereign
      might commit. They were so strong that they might safely be careless. He
      was so feeble that he might safely be suffered to encroach. If he ventured
      too far, chastisement and ruin were at hand. In fact, the people generally
      suffered more from his weakness than from his authority. The tyranny of
      wealthy and powerful subjects was the characteristic evil of the times.
      The royal prerogatives were not even sufficient for the defence of
      property and the maintenance of police.
    </p>
    <p>
      The progress of civilisation introduced a great change. War became a
      science, and, as a necessary consequence, a trade. The great body of the
      people grew every day more reluctant to undergo the inconveniences of
      military service, and better able to pay others for undergoing them. A new
      class of men, therefore, dependent on the Crown alone, natural enemies of
      those popular rights which are to them as the dew to the fleece of Gideon,
      slaves among freemen, freemen among slaves, grew into importance. That
      physical force which, in the dark ages, had belonged to the nobles and the
      commons, and had, far more than any charter or any assembly, been the
      safeguard of their privileges, was transferred entire to the King. <span
      class="pagenum">481</span><a name="link481" id="link481"></a>Monarchy
      gained in two ways. The sovereign was strengthened, the subjects weakened.
      The great mass of the population, destitute of all military discipline and
      organization, ceased to exercise any influence by force on political
      transactions. There have, indeed, during the last hundred and fifty years,
      been many popular insurrections in Europe: but all have failed, except
      those in which the regular army has been induced to join the disaffected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those legal checks which, while the sovereign remained dependent on his
      subjects, had been adequate to the purpose for which they were designed,
      were now found wanting. The dikes which had been sufficient while the
      waters were low were not high enough to keep out the spring-tide. The
      deluge passed over them; and, according to the exquisite illustration of
      Butler, the formal boundaries which had excluded it, now held it in. The
      old constitutions fared like the old shields and coats of mail. They were
      the defences of a rude age: and they did well enough against the weapons
      of a rude age. But new and more formidable means of destruction were
      invented. The ancient panoply became useless; and it was thrown aside to
      rust in lumber-rooms, or exhibited only as part of an idle pageant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus absolute monarchy was established on the Continent. England escaped;
      but she escaped very narrowly. Happily our insular situation, and the
      pacific policy of James, rendered standing armies unnecessary here, till
      they had been for some time kept up in the neighbouring kingdoms. Our
      public men had therefore an opportunity of watching the effects produced
      by this momentous change on governments which bore a close analogy to that
      established in England. Every where <span class="pagenum">482</span><a
      name="link482" id="link482"></a>they saw the power of the monarch
      increasing, the resistance of assemblies which were no longer supported by
      a national force gradually becoming more and more feeble, and at length
      altogether ceasing. The friends and the enemies of liberty perceived with
      equal clearness the causes of this general decay. It is the favourite
      theme of Strafford. He advises the King to procure from the Judges a
      recognition of his right to raise an army at his pleasure. &ldquo;This place
      well fortified,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;for ever vindicates the monarchy at home from
      under the conditions and restraints of subjects.&rdquo; We firmly believe that
      he was in the right. Nay; we believe that, even if no deliberate scheme of
      arbitrary government had been formed by the sovereign and his ministers,
      there was great reason to apprehend a natural extinction of the
      Constitution. If, for example, Charles had played the part of Gustavus
      Adolphus, if he had carried on a popular war for the defence of the
      Protestant cause in Germany, if he had gratified the national pride by a
      series of victories, if he had formed an army of forty or fifty thousand
      devoted soldiers, we do not see what chance the nation would have had of
      escaping from despotism. The Judges would have given as strong a decision
      in favour of camp-money as they gave in favour of ship-money. If they had
      been scrupulous, it would have made little difference. An individual who
      resisted would have been treated as Charles treated Eliot, and as
      Strafford wished to treat Hampden. The Parliament might have been summoned
      once in twenty years, to congratulate a King on his accession, or to give
      solemnity to some great measure of state. Such had been the fate of
      legislative assemblies as powerful, as much respected, as high-spirited,
      as the English Lords and Commons. <span class="pagenum">483</span><a
      name="link483" id="link483"></a>The two Houses, surrounded by the ruins of
      so many free constitutions overthrown or sapped by the new military
      system, were required to intrust the command of an army and the conduct of
      the Irish war to a King who had proposed to himself the destruction of
      liberty as the great end of his policy. We are decidedly of opinion that
      it would have been fatal to comply. Many of those who took the side of the
      King on this question would have cursed their own loyalty, if they had
      seen him return from war at the head of twenty thousand troops, accustomed
      to carnage and free quarters in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      We think, with Mr. Hallam, that many of the Royalist nobility and gentry
      were true friends to the Constitution, and that, but for the solemn
      protestations by which the King bound himself to govern according to the
      law for the future, they never would have joined his standard. But surely
      they underrated the public danger. Falkland is commonly selected as the
      most respectable specimen of this class. He was indeed a man of great
      talents and of great virtues, but, we apprehend, infinitely too fastidious
      for public life. He did not perceive that, in such times as those on which
      his lot had fallen, the duty of a statesman is to choose the better cause
      and to stand by it, in spite of those excesses by which every cause,
      however good in itself, will be disgraced. The present evil always seemed
      to him the worst. He was always going backward and forward; but it should
      be remembered to his honour that it was always from the stronger to the
      weaker side that he deserted. While Charles was oppressing the people,
      Falkland was a resolute champion of liberty. He attacked Strafford. He
      even concurred in strong measures against Episcopacy. But the violence of
      his party <span class="pagenum">484</span><a name="link484"
       id="link484"></a>annoyed him, and drove him to the other party, to be
      equally annoyed there. Dreading the success of the cause which he had
      espoused, disgusted by the courtiers of Oxford, as he had been disgusted
      by the patriots of Westminster, yet bound by honour not to abandon the
      cause for which he was in arms, he pined away, neglected his person, went
      about moaning for peace, and at last rushed desperately on death, as the
      best refuge in such miserable times. If he had lived through the scenes
      that followed, we have little doubt that he would have condemned himself
      to share the exile and beggary of the royal family; that he would then
      have returned to oppose all their measures; that he would have been sent
      to the Tower by the Commons as a stiller of the Popish Plot, and by the
      King as an accomplice in the Rye-House Plot; and that, if he had escaped
      being hanged, first by Scroggs, and then by Jefferies, he would, after
      manfully opposing James the Second through years of tyranny, have been
      seized with a fit of compassion at the very moment of the Revolution, have
      voted for a regency, and died a nonjuror.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not dispute that the royal party contained many excellent men and
      excellent citizens. But this we say, that they did not discern those
      times. The peculiar glory of the Houses of Parliament is that, in the
      great plague and mortality of constitutions, they took their stand between
      the living and the dead. At the very crisis of our destiny, at the very
      moment when the fate which had passed on every other nation was about to
      pass on England, they arrested the danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who conceive that the parliamentary leaders were desirous merely to
      maintain the old constitution, and those who represent them as conspiring
      to subvert <span class="pagenum">485</span><a name="link485"
       id="link485"></a>it, are equally in error. The old constitution, as we
      have attempted to show, could not be maintained. The progress of time, the
      increase of wealth, the diffusion of knowledge, the great change in the
      European system of war, rendered it impossible that any of the monarchies
      of the middle ages should continue to exist on the old footing. The
      prerogative of the crown was constantly advancing. If the privileges of
      the people were to remain absolutely stationary, they would relatively
      retrograde. The monarchical and democratical parts of the government were
      placed in a situation not unlike that of the two brothers in the Fairy
      Queen, one of whom saw the soil of his inheritance daily washed away by
      the tide and joined to that of his rival. The portions had at first been
      fairly meted out. By a natural and constant transfer, the one had been
      extended; the other had dwindled to nothing. A new partition, or a
      compensation, was necessary to restore the original equality.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now, therefore, absolutely necessary to violate the formal part of
      the constitution, in order to preserve its spirit. This might have been
      done, as it was done at the Revolution, by expelling the reigning family,
      and calling to the throne princes who, relying solely on an elective
      title, would find it necessary to respect the privileges and follow the
      advice of the assemblies to which they owed every thing, to pass every
      bill which the Legislature strongly pressed upon them, and to fill the
      offices of state with men in whom the Legislature confided. But, as the
      two Houses did not choose to change the dynasty, it was necessary that
      they should do directly what at the Revolution was done indirectly.
      Nothing is more usual than to hear it said that, if the Houses had
      contented themselves <span class="pagenum">486</span><a name="link486"
       id="link486"></a>with making such a reform in the government under Charles
      as was afterwards made under William, they would have had the highest
      claim to national gratitude: and that in their violence they overshot the
      mark. But how was it possible to make such a settlement under Charles?
      Charles was not, like William and the princes of the Hanoverian line,
      bound by community of interests and dangers to the Parliament. It was
      therefore necessary that he should be bound by treaty and statute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hallam reprobates, in language which has a little surprised us, the
      nineteen propositions into which the Parliament digested its scheme. Is it
      possible to doubt that, if James the Second had remained in the island,
      and had been suffered, as he probably would in that case have been
      suffered, to keep his crown, conditions to the full as hard would have
      been imposed on him? On the other hand, we fully admit that, if the Long
      Parliament had pronounced the departure of Charles from London an
      abdication, and had called Essex or Northumberland to the throne, the new
      prince might have safely been suffered to reign without such restrictions.
      His situation would have been a sufficient guarantee.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the nineteen propositions we see very little to blame except the
      articles against the Catholics. These, however, were in the spirit of that
      age; and to some sturdy churchmen in our own, they may seem to palliate
      even the good which the Long Parliament effected. The regulation with
      respect to new creations of Peers is the only other article about which we
      entertain any doubt. One of the propositions is that the judges shall hold
      their offices during good behaviour. To this surely no exception will be
      taken. The right of directing the <span class="pagenum">487</span><a
      name="link487" id="link487"></a>education and marriage of the princes was
      most properly claimed by the Parliament, on the same ground on which,
      after the Revolution, it was enacted, that no king, on pain of forfeiting
      his throne, should espouse a Papist. Unless we condemn the statesmen of
      the Revolution, who conceived that England could not safely be governed by
      a sovereign married to a Catholic queen, we can scarcely condemn the Long
      Parliament because, having a sovereign so situated, they thought it
      necessary to place him under strict restraints. The influence of Henrietta
      Maria had already been deeply felt in political affairs. In the regulation
      of her family, in the education and marriage of her children, it was still
      more likely to be felt. There might be another Catholic queen; possibly, a
      Catholic king. Little as we are disposed to join in the vulgar clamour on
      this subject, we think that such an event ought to be, if possible,
      averted; and this could only be done, if Charles was to be left on the
      throne, by placing his domestic arrangements under the control of
      Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      A veto on the appointment of ministers was demanded. But this veto
      Parliament has virtually possessed ever since the Revolution. It is no
      doubt very far better that this power of the Legislature should be
      exercised as it is now exercised, when any great occasion calls for
      interference, than that at every change the Commons should have to signify
      their approbation or disapprobation in form. But, unless a new family had
      been placed on the throne, we do not see how this power could have been
      exercised as it is now exercised. We again repeat, that no restraints
      which could be imposed on the princes who reigned after the Revolution
      could have added to the security which their title afforded. They were
      compelled to court their parliaments. But <span class="pagenum">488</span><a
      name="link488" id="link488"></a>from Charles nothing was to be expected
      whicli was not set down in the bond.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not stipulated that the King should give up his negative on acts of
      Parliament. But the Commons had certainly shown a strong disposition to
      exact this security also. &ldquo;Such a doctrine,&rdquo; says Mr. Hallam, &ldquo;was in this
      country as repugnant to the whole history of our laws, as it was
      incompatible with the subsistence of the monarchy in any thing more than a
      nominal preeminence.&rdquo; Now this article has been as completely carried into
      effect by the Revolution as if it had been formally inserted in the Bill
      of Rights and the Act of Settlement. We are surprised, we confess, that
      Mr. Hallam should attach so much importance to a prerogative which has not
      been exercised for a hundred and thirty years, which probably will never
      be exercised again, and which can scarcely, in any conceivable case, be
      exercised for a salutary purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the great security, the security without which every other would have
      been insufficient, was the power of the sword. This both parties
      thoroughly understood. The Parliament insisted on having the command of
      the militia and the direction of the Irish war. &ldquo;By God, not for an hour!&rdquo;
       exclaimed the King. &ldquo;Keep the militia,&rdquo; said the Queen, after the defeat
      of the royal party: &ldquo;Keep the militia; that will bring back every thing.&rdquo;
       That, by the old constitution, no military authority was lodged in the
      Parliament, Mr. Hallam has clearly shown. That it is a species of
      authority which ought not to be permanently lodged in large and divided
      assemblies, must, we think, in fairness be conceded. Opposition,
      publicity, long discussion, frequent compromise; these are the
      characteristics of the proceedings of such assemblies. Unity. <span
      class="pagenum">489</span><a name="link489" id="link489"></a>secrecy,
      decision, are the qualities which military arrangements require. There
      were, therefore, serious objections to the proposition of the Houses on
      this subject. But, on the other hand, to trust such a king, at such a
      crisis, with the very weapon which, in hands less dangerous, had destroyed
      so many free constitutions, would have been the extreme of rashness. The
      jealousy with which the oligarchy of Venice and the States of Holland
      regarded their generals and armies induced them perpetually to interfere
      in matters of which they were incompetent to judge. This policy secured
      them against military usurpation, but placed them under great
      disadvantages in war. The uncontrolled power which the King of France
      exercised over his troops enabled him to conquer his enemies, but enabled
      him also to oppress his people. Was there any intermediate course? None,
      we confess, altogether free from objection. But on the whole, we conceive
      that the best measure would have been that which the Parliament over and
      over proposed, namely, that for a limited time the power of the sword
      should be left to the two Houses, and that it should revert to the Crown
      when the constitution should be firmly established, and when the new
      securities of freedom should be so far strengthened by prescription that
      it would be difficult to employ even a standing army for the purpose of
      subverting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hallam thinks that the dispute might easily have been compromised, by
      enacting that the King should have no power to keep a standing army on
      foot without the consent of Parliament. He reasons as if the question had
      been merely theoretical, and as if at that time no army had been wanted.
      &ldquo;The kingdom,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;might have well dispensed, in that <span
      class="pagenum">490</span><a name="link490" id="link490"></a>age,
      with any military organization.&rdquo; Now, we think that Mr. Hallam overlooks
      the most important circumstance in the whole case. Ireland was actually in
      rebellion; and a great expedition would obviously he necessary to reduce
      that kingdom to obedience. The Houses had therefore to consider, not an
      abstract question of law, but an urgent practical question, directly
      involving the safety of the state. They had to consider the expediency of
      immediately giving a great army to a King who was at least as desirous to
      put down the Parliament of England as to conquer the insurgents of
      Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course we do not mean to defend all the measures of the Houses. Far
      from it. There never was a perfect man. It would, therefore, be the height
      of absurdity to expect a perfect party or a perfect assembly. For large
      bodies are far more likely to err than individuals. The passions are
      inflamed by sympathy; the fear of punishment and the sense of shame are
      diminished by partition. Every day we see men do for their faction what
      they would die rather than do for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely any private quarrel ever happens, in which the right and wrong
      are so exquisitely divided that all the right lies on one side, and all
      the wrong on the other. But here was a schism which separated a great
      nation into two parties. Of these parties, each was composed of many
      smaller parties. Each contained many members, who differed far less from
      their moderate opponents than from their violent allies. Each reckoned
      among its supporters many who were determined in their choice by some
      accident of birth, of connection, or of local situation. Each of them
      attracted to itself in multitudes those fierce and turbid <span
      class="pagenum">491</span><a name="link491" id="link491"></a>spirits,
      to whom the clouds and whirlwinds of the political hurricane are the
      atmosphere of life. A party, like a camp, has its sutlers and
      camp-followers, as well as its soldiers. In its progress it collects round
      it a vast retinue, composed of people who thrive by its custom or are
      amused by its display, who may be sometimes reckoned, in an ostentatious
      enumeration, as forming a part of it, but who give no aid to its
      operations, and take but a languid interest in its success, who relax its
      discipline and dishonour its flag by their irregularities, and who, after
      a disaster, are perfectly ready to cut the throats and rifle the baggage
      of their companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it is in every great division; and thus it was in our civil war. On
      both sides there was, undoubtedly, enough of crime and enough of error to
      disgust any man who did not reflect that the whole history of the species
      is made up of little except crimes and errors. Misanthropy is not the
      temper which qualifies a man to act in great affairs, or to judge of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the Parliament,&rdquo; says Mr. Hallam, &ldquo;it may be said, I think, with not
      greater severity than truth, that scarce two or three public acts of
      justice, humanity, or generosity, and very few of political wisdom or
      courage, are recorded of them, from their quarrel with the King, to their
      expulsion by Cromwell.&rdquo; Those who may agree with us in the opinion which
      we have expressed as to the original demands of the Parliament will
      scarcely concur in this strong censure. The propositions which the Houses
      made at Oxford, at Uxbridge, and at Newcastle, were in strict accordance
      with these demands. In the darkest period of the war, they showed no
      disposition to concede any vital principle. In the fulness of their
      success, they showed <span class="pagenum">492</span><a name="link492"
       id="link492"></a>no disposition to encroach beyond these limits. In this
      respect we cannot but think that they showed justice and generosity, as
      well as political wisdom and courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parliament was certainly far from faultless. We fully agree with Mr.
      Hallam in reprobating their treatment of Laud. For the individual, indeed,
      we entertain a more unmitigated contempt than for any other character in
      our history. The fondness with which a portion of the church regards his
      memory, can be compared only to that perversity of affection which
      sometimes leads a mother to select the monster or the idiot of the family
      as the object of her especial favour. Mr. Hallam has incidentally
      observed, that, in the correspondence of Laud with Strafford, there are no
      indications of a sense of duty towards God or man. The admirers of the
      Archbishop have, in consequence, inflicted upon the public a crowd of
      extracts designed to prove the contrary. Now, in all those passages, we
      see nothing which a prelate as wicked as Pope Alexander or Cardinal Dubois
      might not have written. Those passages indicate no sense of duty to God or
      man, but simply a strong interest in the prosperity and dignity of the
      order to which the writer belonged; an interest which, when kept within
      certain limits, does not deserve censure, but which can never be
      considered as a virtue. Laud is anxious to accommodate satisfactorily the
      disputes in the University of Dublin. He regrets to hear that a church is
      used as a stable, and that the benefices of Ireland are very poor. He is
      desirous that, however small a congregation may be, service should be
      regularly performed. He expresses a wish that the judges of the court
      before which questions of tithe are generally brought should be selected
      <span class="pagenum">493</span><a name="link493" id="link493"></a>with
      a view to the interest of the clergy. All this may be very proper; and it
      may be very proper that an alderman should stand up for the tolls of his
      borough; and an East India director for the charter of his Company. But it
      is ridiculous to say that these things indicate piety and benevolence. No
      primate, though he were the most abandoned of mankind, could wish to see
      the body, with the influence of which his own influence was identical,
      degraded in the public estimation by internal dissensions, by the ruinous
      state of its edifices, and by the slovenly performance of its rites. We
      willingly acknowledge that the particular letters in question have very
      little harm in them; a compliment which cannot often be paid either to the
      writings or to the actions of Laud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bad as the Archbishop was, however, he was not a traitor within the
      statute. Nor was he by any means so formidable as to be a proper subject
      for a retrospective ordinance of the legislature. His mind had not
      expansion enough to comprehend a great scheme, good or bad. His oppressive
      acts were not, like those of the Earl of Strafford, parts of an extensive
      system. They were the luxuries in which a mean and irritable disposition
      indulges itself from day to day, the excesses natural to a little mind in
      a great place. The severest punishment which the two Houses could have
      inflicted on him would have been to set him at liberty and send him to
      Oxford. There he might have staid, tortured by his own diabolical temper,
      hungering for Puritans to pillory and mangle, plaguing the Cavaliers, for
      want of somebody else to plague, with his peevishness and absurdity,
      performing grimaces and antics in the cathedral, continuing that
      incomparable diary, which we never sec without forgetting the vices of his
      heart <span class="pagenum">494</span><a name="link494" id="link494"></a>in
      the imbecility of his intellect, minuting down his dreams, counting the
      drops of blood which fell from his nose, watching the direction of the
      salt, and listening for the note of the screech-owls. Contemptuous mercy
      was the only vengeance which it became the Parliament to take on such a
      ridiculous old bigot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Houses, it must be acknowledged, committed great errors In the conduct
      of the war, or rather one great error, which brought their affairs into a
      condition requiring the most perilous expedients. The parliamentary
      leaders of what may be called the first generation, Essex, Manchester,
      Northumberland, Hollis, even Pym, all the most eminent men, in short,
      Hampden excepted, were inclined to half measures. They dreaded a decisive
      victory almost as much as a decisive overthrow. They wished to bring the
      King into a situation which might render it necessary for him to grant
      their just and wise demands, but not to subvert the constitution or to
      change the dynasty. They were afraid of serving the purposes of those
      fierce and determined enemies of monarchy, who now began to show
      themselves in the lower ranks of the party. The war was, therefore,
      conducted in a languid and inefficient manner. A resolute leader might
      have brought it to a close in a month. At the end of three campaigns,
      however, the event was still dubious; and that it had not been decidedly
      unfavourable to the cause of liberty was principally Owing to the skill
      and energy which the more violent Roundheads had displayed in subordinate
      situations. The conduct of Fairfax and Cromwell at Mars-ton had exhibited
      a remarkable contrast to that of Essex at Edgehill, and to that of Waller
      at Lansdowne.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there be any truth established by the universal experience of nations,
      it is this, that to carry the spirit of <span class="pagenum">495</span><a
      name="link495" id="link495"></a>peace into war is a weak and cruel policy.
      The time of negotiation is the time for deliberation and delay. But when
      an extreme case calls for that remedy which is in its own nature most
      violent, and which, in such cases, is a remedy only because it is violent,
      it is idle to think of mitigating and diluting. Languid war can do nothing
      which negotiation or submission will not do better: and to act on any
      other principle is, not to save blood and money, but to squander them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This the parliamentary leaders found. The third year of hostilities was
      drawing to a close; and they had not conquered the King. They had not
      obtained even those advantages which they had expected from a policy
      obviously erroneous in a military point of view. They had wished to
      husband their resources. They now found that in enterprises like theirs,
      parsimony is the worst profusion. They had hoped to effect a
      reconciliation. The event taught them that the best way to conciliate is
      to bring the work of destruction to a speedy termination. By their
      moderation many lives and much property had been wasted. The angry
      passions which, if the contest had been short, would have died away almost
      as soon as they appeared, had fixed themselves in the form of deep and
      lasting hatred. A military caste had grown up. Those who had been induced
      to take up arms by the patriotic feelings of citizens had begun to
      entertain the professional feelings of soldiers. Above all, the leaders of
      the party had forfeited its confidence. If they had, by their valour and
      abilities, gained a complete victory, their influence might have been
      sufficient to prevent their associates from abusing it. It was now
      necessary to choose more resolute and uncompromising commanders. Unhappily
      the illustrious man who alone united in himself all the <span
      class="pagenum">496</span><a name="link496" id="link496"></a>talents
      and virtues which the crisis required, who alone could have saved his
      country from the present dangers without plunging her into others, who
      alone could have united all the friends of liberty in obedience to his
      commanding genius and his venerable name, was no more. Something might
      still be done. The Houses might still avert that worst of all evils, the
      triumphant return of an imperious and unprincipled master. They might
      still preserve London from all the horrors of rapine, massacre, and lust.
      But their hopes of a victory as spotless as their cause, of a
      reconciliation which might knit together the hearts of all honest
      Englishmen for the defence of the public good, of durable tranquillity, of
      temperate freedom, were buried in the grave of Hampden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The self-denying ordinance was passed, and the army was remodelled. These
      measures were undoubtedly full of danger. But all that was left to the
      Parliament was to take the less of two dangers. And we think that, even if
      they could have accurately foreseen all that followed, their decision
      ought to have been the same. Under any circumstances, we should have
      preferred Cromwell to Charles. But there could be no comparison between
      Cromwell and Charles victorious, Charles restored, Charles enabled to feed
      fat all the hungry grudges of his smiling rancour and his cringing pride.
      The next visit of his Majesty to his faithful Commons would have been more
      serious than that with which he last honoured them; more serious than that
      which their own General paid them some years after. The King would scarce
      have been content with praying that the Lord would deliver him from Vane,
      or with pulling Marten by the cloak. If, by fatal mismanagement, nothing
      was left to England but a choice of <span class="pagenum">497</span><a
      name="link497" id="link497"></a>tyrants, the last tyrant whom she should
      have chosen was Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the apprehension of this worst evil the Houses were soon delivered by
      their new leaders. The armies of Charles were every where routed, his
      fastnesses stormed, his party humbled and subjugated. The King himself
      fell into the hands of the Parliament; and both the King and the
      Parliament soon fell into the hands of the army. The fate of both the
      captives was the same. Both were treated alternately with respect and with
      insult. At length the natural life of one, and the political life of the
      other, were terminated by violence; and the power for which both had
      struggled was united in a single hand. Men naturally sympathize with the
      calamities of individuals; but they are inclined to look on a fallen party
      with contempt rather than with pity. Thus misfortune turned the greatest
      of Parliaments into the despised Rump, and the worst of Kings into the
      Blessed Martyr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hallam decidedly condemns the execution of Charles; and in all that he
      says on that subject we heartily agree. We fully concur with him in
      thinking that a great social schism, such as the civil war, is not to be
      confounded with an ordinary treason, and that the vanquished ought to be
      treated according to the rules, not of municipal, but of international
      law. In this case the distinction is of the less importance, because both
      international and municipal law were in favour of Charles. He was a
      prisoner of war by the former, a King by the latter. By neither was he a
      traitor. If he had been successful, and had put his leading opponents to
      death, he would have deserved severe censure; and this without reference
      to the justice or injustice of his cause. Yet the opponents of <span
      class="pagenum">498</span><a name="link498" id="link498"></a>Charles,
      it must be admitted, were technically guilty of treason. He might have
      sent them to the scaffold without violating any established principle of
      jurisprudence. He would not have been compelled to overturn the whole
      constitution in order to reach them. Here his own case differed widely
      from theirs. Not only was his condemnation in itself a measure which only
      the strongest necessity could vindicate; but it could not be procured
      without taking several previous steps, every one of which would have
      required the strongest necessity to vindicate it. It could not be procured
      without dissolving the government by military force, without establishing
      precedents of the most dangerous description, without creating
      difficulties which the next ten years were spent in removing, without
      pulling down institutions which it soon became necessary to reconstruct,
      and setting up others which almost every man was soon impatient to
      destroy. It was necessary to strike the House of Lords out of the
      constitution, to exclude members of the House of Commons by force, to make
      a new crime, a new tribunal, a new mode of procedure: The whole
      legislative and judicial systems were trampled down for the purpose of
      taking a single head. Not only those parts of the constitution which the
      republicans were desirous to destroy, but those which they wished to
      retain and exalt, were deeply injured by these transactions. High Courts
      of Justice began to usurp the functions of juries. The remaining delegates
      of the people were soon driven from their seats by the same military
      violence which had enabled them to exclude their colleagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Charles had been the last of his line, there would have been an
      intelligible reason for putting him to death. But the blow which
      terminated his life at once <span class="pagenum">499</span><a
      name="link499" id="link499"></a>transferred the allegiance of every
      Royalist to an heir, and an heir who was at liberty. To kill the
      individual was, under such circumstances, not to destroy, but to release
      the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      We detest the character of Charles; but a man ought not to be removed by a
      law <i>ex post facto</i>, even constitutionally procured, merely because
      he is detestable. He must also be very dangerous. We can scarcely conceive
      that any danger which a state can apprehend from any individual could
      justify the violent measures which were necessary to procure a sentence
      against Charles. But in fact the danger amounted to nothing. There was
      indeed danger from the attachment of a large party to his office. But this
      danger his execution only increased. His personal influence was little
      indeed. He had lost the confidence of every party. Churchmen, Catholics,
      Presbyterians, Independents, his enemies, his friends, his tools, English,
      Scotch, Irish, all divisions and subdivisions of his people had been
      deceived by him. His most attached councillors turned away with shame and
      anguish from his false and hollow policy, plot intertwined with plot, mine
      sprung beneath mine, agents disowned, promises evaded, one pledge given in
      private, another in public. &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Secretary,&rdquo; says Clarendon, in a
      letter to Nicholas, &ldquo;those stratagems have given me more sad hours than
      all the misfortunes in war which have befallen the King, and look like the
      effects of God&rsquo;s anger towards us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The abilities of Charles were not formidable. His taste in the fine arts
      was indeed exquisite; and few modern sovereigns have written or spoken
      better. But he was not fit for active life. In negotiation he was always
      trying to dupe others, and duping only himself. <span class="pagenum">500</span><a
      name="link500" id="link500"></a>As a soldier, he was feeble, dilatory, and
      miserably wanting, not in personal courage, but in the presence of mind
      which his station required. His delay at Gloucester saved the
      parliamentary party from destruction. At Naseby, in the very crisis of his
      fortune, his want of self-possession spread a fatal panic through his
      army. The story which Clarendon tells of that affair reminds us of the
      excuses by which Bessus and Bobadil explain their cudgellings. A Scotch
      nobleman, it seems, begged the King not to run upon his death, took hold
      of his bridle, and turned his horse round. No man who had much value for
      his life would have tried to perform the same friendly office on that day
      for Oliver Cromwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing, and one alone, could make Charles dangerous, a violent death.
      His tyranny could not break the high spirit of the English people. His
      arms could not conquer, his arts could not deceive them; but his
      humiliation and his execution melted them into a generous compassion. Men
      who die on a scaffold for political offences almost always die well. The
      eyes of thousands are fixed upon them. Enemies and admirers are watching
      their demeanour. Every tone of voice, every change of colour, is to go
      down to posterity. Escape is impossible. Supplication is vain. In such a
      situation, pride and despair have often been known to nerve the weakest
      minds with fortitude adequate to the occasion. Charles died patiently and
      bravely; not more patiently or bravely, indeed, than many other victims of
      political rage; not more patiently or bravely than his own Judges, who
      were not only killed, but tortured; or than Vane, who had always been
      considered as a timid man. However, the King&rsquo;s conduct during his trial
      and at his execution made a prodigious <span class="pagenum">501</span><a
      name="link501" id="link501"></a>impression. His subjects began to love his
      memory as heartily as they had hated his person; and posterity has
      estimated his character from his death rather than from his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      To represent Charles as a martyr in the cause of Episcopacy is absurd.
      Those who put him to death cared as little for the Assembly of Divines as
      for the Convocation, and would, in all probability, only have hated him
      the more if he had agreed to set up the Presbyterian discipline. Indeed,
      in spite of the opinion of Mr. Hallam, we are inclined to think that the
      attachment of Charles to the Church of England was altogether political.
      Human nature is, we admit, so capricious that there may be a single
      sensitive point in a conscience which every where else is callous. A man
      without truth or humanity may have some strange scruples about a trifle.
      There was one devout warrior in the royal camp whose piety bore a great
      resemblance to that which is ascribed to the King. We mean Colonel Turner.
      That gallant Cavalier was hanged, after the Restoration, for a flagitious
      burglary. At the gallows he told the crowd that his mind received great
      consolation from one reflection: he had always taken off his hat when he
      went into a church. The character of Charles would scarcely rise in our
      estimation, if we believed that he was pricked in conscience after the
      manner of this worthy loyalist, and that while violating all the first
      rules of Christian morality, he was sincerely scrupulous about
      church-government. But we acquit him of such weakness. In 1641, he
      deliberately confirmed the Scotch Declaration which stated that the
      government of the church by archbishops and bishops was contrary to the
      word of God. In 1645, he appears to have offered to set up Popery in
      Ireland. That a <span class="pagenum">502</span><a name="link502"
       id="link502"></a>King who had established the Presbyterian religion in one
      kingdom, and who was willing to establish the Catholic religion in
      another, should have insurmountable scruples about the ecclesiastical
      constitution of the third, is altogether incredible. He himself says in
      his letters that he looks on Episcopacy as a stronger support of
      monarchical power than even the army. From causes which we have already
      considered, the Established Church had been, since the Reformation, the
      great bulwark of the prerogative. Charles wished, therefore, to preserve
      it. He thought himself necessary both to the Parliament and to the army.
      He did not foresee, till too late, that, by paltering with the
      Presbyterians, he should put both them and himself into the power of a
      fiercer and more daring party. If he had foreseen it, we suspect that the
      royal blood which still cries to Heaven, every thirtieth of January, for
      judgments only to be averted by salt-fish and egg-sauce, would never have
      been shed. One who had swallowed the Scotch Declaration would scarcely
      strain at the Covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of Charles and the strong measures which led to it raised
      Cromwell to a height of power fatal to the infant Commonwealth. No men
      occupy so splendid a place in history as those who have founded monarchies
      on the ruins of republican institutions. Their glory, if not of the
      purest, is assuredly of the most seductive and dazzling kind. In nations
      broken to the curb, in nations long accustomed to be transferred from one
      tyrant to another, a man without eminent qualities may easily gain supreme
      power. The defection of a troop of guards, a conspiracy of eunuchs, a
      popular tumult, might place an indolent senator or a brutal soldier on the
      throne of the Roman world. Similar <span class="pagenum">503</span><a
      name="link503" id="link503"></a>revolutions have often occurred in the
      despotic states of Asia. But a community which has heard the voice of
      truth and experienced the pleasures of liberty, in which the merits of
      statesmen and of systems are freely canvassed, in which obedience is paid,
      not to persons but to laws, in which magistrates are regarded, not as the
      lords, but as the servants of the public, in which the excitement of party
      is a necessary of life, in which political warfare is reduced to a system
      of tactics; such a community is not easily reduced to servitude. Beasts of
      burden may easily be managed by a new master. But will the wild ass submit
      to the bonds? Will the unicorn serve and abide by the crib? Will leviathan
      hold out his nostrils to the hook? The mythological conqueror of the East,
      whose enchantments reduced wild beasts to the tameness of domestic cattle,
      and who harnessed lions and tigers to his chariot, is but an imperfect
      type of those extraordinary minds which have thrown a spell on the fierce
      spirits of nations unaccustomed to control, and have compelled raging
      factions to obey their reins and swell their triumph. The enterprise, be
      it good or bad, is one which requires a truly great man. It demands
      courage, activity, energy, wisdom, firmness, conspicuous virtues, or vices
      so splendid and alluring as to resemble virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who have succeeded in this arduous undertaking form a very small and
      a very remarkable class. Parents of tyranny, heirs of freedom, kings among
      citizens, citizens among kings, they unite in themselves the
      characteristics of the system which springs from them, and those of the
      system from which they have sprung. Their reigns shine with a double
      light, the last and dearest rays of departing freedom mingled with the
      first and brightest glories of empire in its <span class="pagenum">504</span><a
      name="link504" id="link504"></a>dawn. The high qualities of such a prince
      lend to despotism itself a charm drawn from the liberty under which they
      were formed, and which they have destroyed. He resembles an European who
      settles within the Tropics, and carries thither the strength and the
      energetic habits acquired in regions more propitious to the constitution.
      He differs as widely from princes nursed in the purple of imperial
      cradles, as the companions of Gama from their dwarfish and imbecile
      progeny which, born in a climate unfavourable to its growth and beauty,
      degenerates more and more, at every descent, from the qualities of the
      original conquerors.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this class three men stand preeminent, Cæsar, Cromwell, and Bonaparte.
      The highest place in this remarkable triumvirate belongs undoubtedly to
      Cæsar. He united the talents of Bonaparte to those of Cromwell; and he
      possessed also, what neither Cromwell nor Bonaparte possessed, learning,
      taste, wit, eloquence, the sentiments and the manners of an accomplished
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between Cromwell and Napoleon Mr. Hallam has instituted a parallel,
      scarcely less ingenious than that which Burke has drawn between Richard
      Cour de Lion and Charles the Twelfth of Sweden. In this parallel, however,
      and indeed throughout his work, we think that he hardly gives Cromwell
      fair measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cromwell,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;far unlike his antitype, never showed any signs of a
      legislative mind, or any desire to place his renown on that noblest basis,
      the amelioration of social institutions.&rdquo; The difference in this respect,
      we conceive, was not in the character of the men, but in the characters of
      the revolutions by means of which they rose to power. The civil war in
      England <span class="pagenum">505</span><a name="link505" id="link505"></a>had
      been undertaken to defend and restore; the republicans of France set
      themselves to destroy. In England, the principles of the common law had
      never been disturbed, and most even of its forms had been held sacred. In
      France, the law and its ministers had been swept away together. In France,
      therefore, legislation necessarily became the first business of the first
      settled government which rose on the ruins of the old system. The admirers
      of Inigo Jones have always maintained that his works are inferior to those
      of Sir Christopher Wren, only because the great fire of London gave Wren
      such a field for the display of his powers as no architect in the history
      of the world ever possessed. Similar allowance must be made for Cromwell.
      If he erected little that was new, it was because there had been no
      general devastation to clear a space for him. As it was, he reformed the
      representative system in a most judicious manner. He rendered the
      administration of justice uniform throughout the island. We will quote a
      passage from his speech to the Parliament in September, 1656, which
      contains, we think, simple and rude as the diction is, stronger
      indications of a legislative mind, than are to be found in the whole range
      of orations delivered on such occasions before or since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one general grievance in the nation. It is the law. I think, I
      may say it, I have as eminent judges in this land as have been had, or
      that the nation has had for these many years. Truly, I could be particular
      as to the executive part, to the administration; but that would trouble
      you. But the truth of it is, there are wicked and abominable laws that
      will be in your power to alter. To hang a man for sixpence, threepence, I
      know not what,&mdash;to hang for a <span class="pagenum">506</span><a
      name="link506" id="link506"></a>trifle, and pardon murder, is in the
      ministration of the law through the ill framing of it. I have known in my
      experience abominable murders quitted; and to see men lose their lives for
      petty matters! This is a thing that God will reckon for; and I wish it may
      not lie upon this nation a day longer than you have an opportunity to give
      a remedy; and I hope I shall cheerfully join with you in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hallam truly says that, though it is impossible to rank Cromwell with
      Napoleon as a general, yet &ldquo;his exploits were as much above the level of
      his contemporaries, and more the effects of an original uneducated
      capacity.&rdquo; Bonaparte was trained in the best military schools; the army
      which he led to Italy was one of the finest that ever existed. Cromwell
      passed his youth and the prime of his manhood in a civil situation. He
      never looked on war till he was more than forty years old. He had first to
      form himself, and then to form his troops. Out of raw levies he created an
      army, the bravest and the best disciplined, the most orderly in peace, and
      the most terrible in war, that Europe had seen. He called this body into
      existence. He led it to conquest. He never fought a battle without gaining
      it. He never gained a battle without annihilating the force opposed to
      him. Yet his victories were not the highest glory of his military system.
      The respect which his troops paid to property, their attachment to the
      laws and religion of their country, their submission to the civil power,
      their temperance, their intelligence, their industry, are without
      parallel. It was after the Restoration that the spirit which their great
      leader had infused into them was most signally displayed. At the command
      of the established government, an established government which <span
      class="pagenum">507</span><a name="link507" id="link507"></a>had no
      means of enforcing obedience, fifty thousand soldiers, whose backs no
      enemy had ever seen, either in domestic or in continental war, laid down
      their arms, and retired into the mass of the people, thenceforward to be
      distinguished only by superior diligence, sobriety, and regularity in the
      pursuits of peace, from the other members of the community which they had
      saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the general spirit and character of his administration, we think
      Cromwell far superior to Napoleon. &ldquo;In civil government,&rdquo; says Mr. Hallam,
      &ldquo;there can be no adequate parallel between one who had sucked only the
      dregs of a besotted fanaticism, and one to whom the stores of reason and
      philosophy were open.&rdquo; These expressions, it seems to us, convey the
      highest eulogium on our great countryman. Reason and philosophy did not
      teach the conqueror of Europe to command his passions, or to pursue, as a
      first object, the happiness of his people. They did not prevent him from
      risking his fame and his power in a frantic contest against the principles
      of human nature and the laws of the physical world, against the rage of
      the winter and the liberty of the sea. They did not exempt him from the
      influence of that most pernicious of superstitions, a presumptuous
      fatalism. They did not preserve him from the inebriation of prosperity, or
      restrain him from indecent querulousness in adversity. On the other hand,
      the fanaticism of Cromwell never urged him on impracticable undertakings,
      or confused his perception of the public good. Our countryman, inferior to
      Bonaparte in invention, was far superior to him in wisdom. The French
      Emperor is among conquerors what Voltaire is among writers, a miraculous
      child. His splendid genius was frequently clouded by fits of humour as
      absurdly perverse as those of the pet <span class="pagenum">508</span><a
      name="link508" id="link508"></a>of the nursery, who quarrels with his
      food, and dashes his playthings to pieces. Cromwell was emphatically a
      man. He possessed, in an eminent degree, that masculine and full-grown
      robustness of mind, that equally diffused intellectual health, which, if
      our national partiality does not mislead us, has peculiarly characterised
      the great men of England. Never was any ruler so conspicuously born for
      sovereignty. The cup which has intoxicated almost all others sobered him.
      His spirit, restless from its own buoyancy in a lower sphere, reposed in
      majestic placidity as soon as it had reached the level congenial to it. He
      had nothing in common with that large class of men who distinguish
      themselves in subordinate posts, and whose incapacity becomes obvious as
      soon as the public voice summons them to take the lead. Rapidly as his
      fortunes grew, his mind expanded more rapidly still. Insignificant as a
      private citizen, he was a great general; he was a still greater prince.
      Napoleon had a theatrical manner, in which the coarseness of a
      revolutionary guard-room was blended with the ceremony of the old Court of
      Versailles. Cromwell, by the confession even of his enemies, exhibited in
      his demeanour the simple and natural nobleness of a man neither ashamed of
      his origin nor vain of his elevation, of a man who had found his proper
      place in society, and who felt secure that he was competent to fill it.
      Easy, even to familiarity, where his own dignity was concerned, he was
      punctilious only for his country. His own character he left to take care
      of itself; he left it to be defended by his victories in war, and his
      reforms in peace. But he was a jealous and implacable guardian of the
      public honour. He suffered a crazy Quaker to insult him in the gallery of
      Whitehall, and <span class="pagenum">509</span><a name="link509"
       id="link509"></a>revenged himself only by liberating him and giving him a
      dinner. But he was prepared to risk the chancel of war to avenge the blood
      of a private Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sovereign ever carried to the throne so large a portion of the best
      qualities of the middling orders, so strong a sympathy with the feelings
      and interests of his people. He was sometimes driven to arbitrary
      measures; but he had a high, stout, honest, English heart. Hence it was
      that he loved to surround his throne with such men as Hale and Blake.
      Hence it was that he allowed so large a share of political liberty to his
      subjects, and that, even when an opposition dangerous to his power and to
      his person almost compelled him to govern by the sword, he was still
      anxious to leave a germ from which, at a more favourable season, free
      institutions might spring. We firmly believe that, if his first Parliament
      had not commenced its debates by disputing his title, his government would
      have been as mild at home as it was energetic and able abroad. He was a
      soldier; he had risen by war. Had his ambition been of an impure or
      selfish kind, it would have been easy for him to plunge his country into
      continental hostilities on a large scale, and to dazzle the restless
      factions which he ruled, by the splendour of his victories. Some of his
      enemies have sneeringly remarked, that in the successes obtained under his
      administration he had no personal share; as if a man who had raised
      himself from obscurity to empire solely by his military talents could have
      any unworthy reason for shrinking from military enterprise. This reproach
      is his highest glory. In the success of the English navy he could have no
      selfish interest. Its triumphs added nothing to his fame; its increase
      added nothing to his means of overawing his enemies; its <span
      class="pagenum">510</span><a name="link510" id="link510"></a>great
      leader was not his friend. Yet he took a peculiar pleasure in encouraging
      that noble service which, of all the instruments employed by an English
      government, is the most impotent for mischief, and the most powerful for
      good. His administration was glorious, but with no vulgar glory. It was
      not one of those periods of overstrained and convulsive exertion which
      necessarily produce debility and langour. Its energy was natural,
      healthful, temperate. He placed England at the head of the Protestant
      interest, and in the first rank of Christian powers. He taught every
      nation to value her friendship and to dread her enmity. But he did not
      squander her resources in a vain attempt to invest her with that supremacy
      which no power, in the modern system of Europe, can safely affect, or can
      long retain.
    </p>
    <p>
      This noble and sober wisdom had its reward. If he did not carry the
      banners of the Commonwealth in triumph to distant capitals, if he did not
      adorn Whitehall with the spoils of the Stadthouse and the Louvre, if he
      did not portion out Flanders and Germany into principalities for his
      kinsmen and his generals, he did not, on the other hand, see his country
      overrun by the armies of nations which his ambition had provoked. He did
      not drag out the last years of his life an exile and a prisoner, in an
      unhealthy climate and under an ungenerous gaoler, raging with the impotent
      desire of vengeance, and brooding over visions of departed glory. He went
      down to his grave in the fulness of power and fame; and he left to his son
      an authority which any man of ordinary firmness and prudence would have
      retained.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for the weakness of that foolish Ishbosheth, the opinions which we
      have been expressing would, we <span class="pagenum">511</span><a
      name="link511" id="link511"></a>believe, now have formed the orthodox
      creed of good Englishmen. We might now be writing under the government of
      his Highness Oliver the Fifth or Richard the Fourth, Protector, by the
      grace of God, of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and
      the dominions thereto belonging. The form of the great founder of the
      dynasty, on horseback, as when he led the charge at Naseby, or on foot, as
      when he took the mace from the table of the Commons, would adorn our
      squares and overlook our public offices from Charing-Cross; and sermons in
      his praise would be duly preached on his lucky day, the third of
      September, by court-chaplains, guiltless of the abomination of the
      surplice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though his memory has not been taken under the patronage of any
      party, though every device has been used to blacken it, though to praise
      him would long have been a punishable crime, truth and merit at last
      prevail. Cowards who had trembled at the very sound of his name, tools of
      office who, like Downing, had been proud of the honour of lacqueying his
      coach, might insult him in loyal speeches and addresses. Venal poets might
      transfer to the King the same eulogies, little the worse for wear, which
      they had bestowed on the Protector. A fickle multitude might crowd to
      shout and scoff round the gibbeted remains of the greatest Prince and
      Soldier of the age. But when the Dutch cannon startled an effeminate
      tyrant in his own palace, when the conquests which had been won by the
      armies of Cromwell were sold to pamper the harlots of Charles, when
      Englishmen were sent to fight under foreign banners, against the
      independence of Europe and the Protestant religion, many honest hearts
      swelled in secret at the thought of one who had never <span class="pagenum">512</span><a
      name="link512" id="link512"></a>suffered his country to be ill used by any
      but himself. It must indeed have been difficult for any Englishman to see
      the salaried Viceroy of France, at the most important crisis of his fate,
      sauntering through his harem, yawning and talking nonsense over a
      dispatch, or beslobbering his brother and his courtiers in a fit of
      maudlin affection, without a respectful and tender remembrance of him
      before whose genius the young-pride of Lewis and the veteran craft of
      Mazarin had stood rebuked, who had humbled Spain on the land and Holland
      on the sea, and whose imperial voice had arrested the sails of the Lybian
      pirates and the persecuting fires of Rome. Even to the present day his
      character, though constantly attacked, and scarcely ever defended, is
      popular with the great body of our countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most blameable act of his life was the execution of Charles. We have
      already strongly condemned that proceeding; but we by no means consider it
      as one which attaches any peculiar stigma of infamy to the names of those
      who participated in it. It was an unjust and injudicious display of
      violent party spirit; but it was not a cruel or perfidious measure. It had
      all those features which distinguish the errors of magnanimous and
      intrepid spirits from base and malignant crimes.

      From the moment that Cromwell is dead and buried, we go on in almost
      perfect harmony with Mr. Hallam to the end of his book. The times which
      followed the Restoration peculiarly require that unsparing impartiality
      which is his most distinguishing virtue. No part of our history, during
      the last three centuries, presents a spectacle of such general dreariness.
      The whole breed of our statesmen seems to have degenerated; <span
      class="pagenum">513</span><a name="link513" id="link513"></a>and
      their moral and intellectual littleness strikes us with the more disgust,
      because we sec it placed in immediate contrast with the high and majestic
      qualities of the race which they succeeded. In the great civil war, even
      the bad cause had been rendered respectable and amiable by the purity and
      elevation of mind which many of its friends displayed. Under Charles the
      Second, the best and noblest of ends was disgraced by means the most cruel
      and sordid. The rage of faction succeeded to the love of liberty. Loyalty
      died away into servility. We look in vain among the leading politicians of
      either side for steadiness of principle, or even for that vulgar fidelity
      to party which, in our time, it is esteemed infamous to violate. The
      inconsistency, perfidy, and baseness, which the leaders constantly
      practised, which their followers defended, and which the great body of the
      people regarded, as it seems, with little disapprobation, appear in the
      present age almost incredible. In the age of Charles the First, they
      would, we believe, have excited as much astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Man, however, is always the same. And when so marked a difference appears
      between two generations, it is certain that the solution may be found in
      their respective circumstances. The principal statesmen of the reign of
      Charles the Second were trained during the civil war and the revolutions
      which followed it. Such a period is eminently favourable to the growth of
      quick and active talents. It forms a class of men, shrewd, vigilant,
      inventive; of men whose dexterity triumphs over the most perplexing
      combinations of circumstances, whose presaging instinct no sign of the
      times can elude. But it is an unpropitious season for the firm and
      masculine virtues. The statesman who enters on his career at such a time,
      can form no permanent <span class="pagenum">514</span><a
      name="link514" id="link514"></a>connections, can make no accurate
      observations on the higher parts of political science. Before he can
      attach himself to a party, it is scattered. Before he can study the nature
      of a government, it is overturned. The oath of abjuration comes close on
      the oath of allegiance. The association which was subscribed yesterday is
      burned by the hangman to-day. In the midst of the constant eddy and
      change, self-preservation becomes the first object of the adventurer. It
      is a task too hard for the strongest head to keep itself from becoming
      giddy in the eternal whirl. Public spirit is out of the question. A laxity
      of principle, without which no public man can be eminent or even safe,
      becomes too common to be scandalous; and the whole nation looks coolly on
      Instances of apostacy which would startle the foulest turncoat of more
      settled times.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of France since the Revolution affords some striking
      illustrations of these remarks. The same man was a servant of the
      Republic, of Bonaparte, of Lewis the Eighteenth, of Bonaparte again after
      his return from Elba, of Lewis again after his return from Ghent. Yet all
      these manifold treasons by no means seemed to destroy his influence, or
      even to fix any peculiar stain of infamy on his character. We, to be sure,
      did not know what to make of him; but his countrymen did not seem to be
      shocked; and in truth they had little right to be shocked: for there was
      scarcely one Frenchman distinguished in the state or in the army, who had
      not, according to the best of his talents and opportunities, emulated the
      example. It was natural, too, that this should be the case. The rapidity
      and violence with which change followed change in the affairs of France
      towards the close of the last century had taken away the reproach of
      inconsistency, unfixed <span class="pagenum">515</span><a
      name="link515" id="link515"></a>the principles of public men, and produced
      in many minds a general scepticism and indifference about principles of
      government.
    </p>
    <p>
      No Englishman who has studied attentively the reign of Charles the Second
      will think himself entitled to indulge in any feelings of national
      superiority over the <i>Dictionnaire des Girouettes</i>. Shaftesbury was
      surely a far less respectable man than Talleyrand; and it would be
      injustice even to Fouché to compare him with Lauderdale. Nothing, indeed,
      can more clearly show how low the standard of political morality had
      fallen in this country than the fortunes of the two British statesmen whom
      we have named. The government wanted a ruffian to carry on the most
      atrocious system of mis-government with which any nation was ever cursed,
      to extirpate Presbyterianism by fire and sword, by the drowning of women,
      by the frightful torture of the boot. And they found him among the chiefs
      of the rebellion and the subscribers of the Covenant. The opposition
      looked for a chief to head them in the most desperate attacks ever made,
      under the forms of the Constitution, on any English administration: and
      they selected the minister who had the deepest share in the worst acts of
      the Court, the soul of the Cabal, the counsellor who had shut up the
      Exchequer and urged on the Dutch war. The whole political drama was of the
      same cast. No unity of plan, no decent propriety of character and costume,
      could be found in that wild and monstrous harlequinade. The whole was made
      up of extravagant transformations and burlesque contrasts; Atheists turned
      Puritans; Puritans turned Atheists; republicans defending the divine right
      of Kings; prostitute courtiers clamouring for the liberties of the people;
      judges inflaming the rage of mobs; patriots pocketing <span class="pagenum">516</span><a
      name="link516" id="link516"></a>bribes from foreign powers; a Popish
      prince torturing Presbyterians into Episcopacy in one part of the island;
      Presbyterians cutting off the heads of Popish noblemen and gentlemen in
      the other. Public opinion has its natural flux and reflux. After a violent
      burst, there is commonly a reaction. But vicissitudes so extraordinary as
      those which marked the reign of Charles the Second can only be explained
      by supposing an utter want of principle in the political world. On neither
      side was there fidelity enough to face a reverse. Those honourable
      retreats from power which, in later days, parties have often made, with
      loss, but still in good order, in firm union, with unbroken spirit and
      formidable means of annoyance, were utterly unknown. As soon as a check
      took place a total rout followed: arms and colours were thrown away. The
      vanquished troops, like the Italian mercenaries of the fourteenth and
      fifteenth centuries, enlisted on the very field of battle, in the service
      of the conquerors. In a nation proud of its sturdy justice and plain good
      sense, no party could be found to take a firm middle stand between the
      worst of oppositions and the worst of courts. When, on charges as wild as
      Mother Goose&rsquo;s tales, on the testimony of wretches who proclaimed
      themselves to be spies and traitors, and whom everybody now believes to
      have been also liars and murderers, the offal of gaols and brothels, the
      leavings of the hangman&rsquo;s whip and shears, Catholics guilty of nothing but
      their religion were led like sheep to the Protestant shambles, where were
      the loyal Tory gentry and the passively obedient clergy? And where, when
      the time of retribution came, when laws were strained and juries packed to
      destroy the leaders of the Whigs, when charters were invaded, when
      Jefferies and Kirke were making <span class="pagenum">517</span><a
      name="link517" id="link517"></a>Somersetshire what Lauderdale and Graham
      had made Scotland, where were the ten thousand brisk boys of Shaftesbury,
      the members of ignoramus juries, the wearers of the Polish medal?
      All-powerful to destroy others, unable to save themselves, the members of
      the two parties oppressed and were oppressed, murdered and were murdered,
      in their turn. No lucid interval occurred between the frantic paroxysms of
      two contradictory illusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the frequent changes of the government during the twenty years which
      had preceded the Restoration, this unsteadiness is in a great measure to
      be attributed. Other causes had also been at work. Even if the country had
      been governed by the house of Cromwell or by the remains of the Long
      Parliament, the extreme austerity of the Puritans would necessarily have
      produced a revulsion. Towards the close of the Protectorate many signs
      indicated that a time of license was at hand. But the restoration of
      Charles the Second rendered the change wonderfully rapid and violent.
      Profligacy became a test of orthodoxy and loyalty, a qualification for
      rank and office. A deep and general taint infected the morals of the most
      influential classes, and spread itself through every province of letters.
      Poetry inflamed the passions; philosophy undermined the principles;
      divinity itself, inculcating an abject reverence for the Court, gave
      additional effect to the licentious example of the Court. We look in vain
      for those qualities which lend a charm to the errors of high and ardent
      natures, for the generosity, the tenderness, the chivalrous delicacy,
      which ennoble appetites into passions, and impart to vice itself a portion
      of the majesty of virtue. The excesses of that age remind us of the
      humours of a gang of footpads, revelling with their <span class="pagenum">518</span><a
      name="link518" id="link518"></a>favourite beauties at a flash-house. In
      the fashionable libertinism there is a hard, cold ferocity, an impudence,
      a lowness, a dirtiness, which can be paralleled only among the heroes and
      heroines of that filthy and heartless literature which encouraged it. One
      nobleman of great abilities wanders about as a Merry-Andrew. Another
      harangues the mob stark naked from a window. A third lays an ambush to
      cudgel a man who has offended him. A knot of gentlemen of high rank and
      influence combine to push their fortunes at court by circulating stories
      intended to ruin an innocent girl, stories which had no foundation, and
      which, if they had been true, would never have passed the lips of a man of
      honour. A dead child is found in the palace, the offspring of some maid of
      honour by some courtier, or perhaps by Charles himself. The whole flight
      of pandars and buffoons pounce upon it, and carry it in triumph to the
      royal laboratory, where his Majesty, after a brutal jest, dissects it for
      the amusement of the assembly, and probably of its father among the rest.
      The favourite Duchess stamps about Whitehall, cursing and swearing. The
      ministers employ their time at the council-board in making mouths at each
      other and taking off each other&rsquo;s gestures for the amusement of the King.
      The Peers at a conference begin to pommel each other and to tear collars
      and periwigs. A speaker in the House of Commons gives offence to the
      Court. He is waylaid by a gang of bullies, and his nose is cut to the
      bone. This ignominous dissoluteness, or rather, if we may venture to
      designate it by the only proper word, blackguardism of feeling and
      manners, could not but spread from private to public life. The cynical
      sneers, the epicurean sophistry, which had driven honour and virtue from
      one part of the character, extended <span class="pagenum">519</span><a
      name="link519" id="link519"></a>their influence over every other. The
      second generation of the statesmen of this reign were worthy pupils of the
      schools in which they had been trained, of the gaming-table of Grammont,
      and the tiring-room of Nell. In no other age could such a trifler as
      Buckingham have exercised any political influence. In no other age could
      the path to power and glory have been thrown open to the manifold infamies
      of Churchill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of Churchill shows, more clearly per haps than that of any
      other individual, the malignity and extent of the corruption which had
      eaten into the heart of the public morality. An English gentleman of good
      family attaches himself to a Prince who has seduced his sister, and
      accepts rank and wealth as the price of her shame and his own. He then
      repays by ingratitude the benefits which he has purchased by ignominy,
      betrays his patron in a manner which the best cause cannot excuse, and
      commits an act, not only of private treachery, but of distinct military
      desertion. To his conduct at the crisis of the fate of James, no service
      in modern times has, as far as we remember, furnished any parallel. The
      conduct of Ney, scandalous enough no doubt, is the very fastidiousness of
      honour in comparison of it. The perfidy of Arnold approaches it most
      nearly. In our age and country no talents, no services, no party
      attachments, could bear any man up under such mountains of infamy. Yet,
      even before Churchill had performed those great actions which in some
      degree redeem his character with posterity, the load lay very lightly on
      him. He had others in abundance to keep him in countenance. Godolphin,
      Orford, Dauby, the trimmer Halifax, the renegade Sunderland, were all men
      of the same class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where such was the political morality of the noble <span class="pagenum">520</span><a
      name="link520" id="link520"></a>and the wealthy, it may easily be
      conceived that those professions which, even in the best times, are
      peculiarly liable to corruption, were in a frightful state. Such a bench
      and such a bar England has never seen. Jones, Scroggs, Jefferies, North,
      Wright, Sawyer, Williams, are to this day the spots and blemishes of our
      legal chronicles. Differing in constitution and in situation, whether
      blustering or cringing, whether persecuting Protestants or Catholics, they
      were equally unprincipled and inhuman. The part which the Church played
      was not equally atrocious; but it must have been exquisitely diverting to
      a scoffer. Never were principles so loudly professed, and so shamelessly
      abandoned. The Royal prerogative had been magnified to the skies in
      theological works. The doctrine of passive obedience had been preached
      from innumerable pulpits. The University of Oxford had sentenced the works
      of the most moderate constitutionalists to the flames. The accession of a
      Catholic King, the frightful cruelties committed in the west of England,
      never shook the steady loyalty of the clergy. But did they serve the Kino;
      for nought? He laid his hand on them, and they cursed him to his face. He
      touched the revenue of a college and the liberty of some prelates; and the
      whole profession set up a yell worthy of Hugh Peters himself. Oxford sent
      her plate to an invader with more alacrity than she had shown when Charles
      the First requested it. Nothing was said about the wickedness of
      resistance till resistance had done its work, till the anointed vicegerent
      of Heaven had been driven away, and till it had become plain that he would
      never be restored, or would be restored at least under strict limitations.
      The clergy went back, it must be owned, to their old theory, as soon as
      they found that it would do them no harm. <span class="pagenum">521</span><a
      name="link521" id="link521"></a>It is principally to the general baseness
      and profligacy of the times that Clarendon is indebted for his high
      reputation. He was, in every respect, a man unfit for his age, at once too
      good for it and too bad for it. He seemed to be one of the ministers of
      Elizabeth, transplanted at once to a state of society widely different
      from that in which the abilities of such ministers had been serviceable.
      In the sixteenth century, the Royal prerogative had scarcely been called
      in question. A Minister who held it high was in no danger, so long as he
      used it well. That attachment to the Crown, that extreme jealousy of
      popular encroachments, that love, half religious half political, for the
      Church, which, from the beginning of the second session of the Long
      Parliament, showed itself in Clarendon, and which his sufferings, his long
      residence in France, and his high station in the government, served to
      strengthen, would, a hundred years earlier, have secured to him the favour
      of his sovereign without rendering him odious to the people. His probity,
      his correctness in private life, his decency of deportment, and his
      general ability, would not have misbecome a colleague of Walsingham and
      Burleigh. But, in the times on which he was cast, his errors and his
      virtues were alike out of place. He imprisoned men without trial. He was
      accused of raising unlawful contributions on the people for the support of
      the army. The abolition of the act which ensured the frequent holding of
      Parliaments was one of his favourite objects. He seems to have meditated
      the revival of the Star Chamber and the High Commission Court. His zeal
      for the prerogative made him unpopular; but it could not secure to him the
      favour of a master far more desirous of ease and pleasure than of power.
      <span class="pagenum">522</span><a name="link522" id="link522"></a>Charles
      would rather have lived in exile and privacy, with abundance of money, a
      crowd of mimics to amuse him, and a score of mistresses, than have
      purchased the absolute dominion of the world by the privations and
      exertions to which Clarendon was constantly urging him. A councillor who
      was always bringing him papers and giving him advice, and who stoutly
      refused to compliment Lady Castlemaine and to carry messages to Mistress
      Stewart, soon became more hateful to him than ever Cromwell had been.
      Thus, considered by the people as an oppressor, by the Court as a censor,
      the Minister fell from his high office with a ruin more violent and
      destructive than could ever have been his fate, if he had either respected
      the principles of the Constitution or flattered the vices of the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hallam has formed, we think, a most correct estimate of the character
      and administration of Clarendon. But he scarcely makes a sufficient
      allowance for the wear and tear which honesty almost necessarily sustains
      in the friction of political life, and which, in times so rough as those
      through which Clarendon passed, must be very considerable. When these are
      fairly estimated, we think that his integrity may be allowed to pass
      muster. A high-minded man he certainly was not, either in public or in
      private affairs. His own account of his conduct in the affair of his
      daughter is the most extraordinary passage in autobiography. We except
      nothing even in the Confessions of Rousseau. Several writers have taken a
      perverted and absurd pride in representing themselves as detestable; but
      no other ever laboured hard to make himself despicable and ridiculous. In
      one important particular Clarendon showed as little regard to the <span
      class="pagenum">523</span><a name="link523" id="link523"></a>honour
      of his country as he had shown to that of his family. He accepted a
      subsidy from France for the relief of Portugal. But this method of
      obtaining money was afterwards practised to a much greater extent, and for
      objects much less respectable, both by the Court and by the Opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      These pecuniary transactions are commonly considered as the most
      disgraceful part of the history of those times; and they were no doubt
      highly reprehensible. Yet, in justice to the Whigs and to Charles himself,
      we must admit that they were not so shameful or atrocious as at the
      present day they appear. The effect of violent animosities between parties
      has always been an indifference to the general welfare and honour of the
      State. A politician, where factions run high, is interested not for the
      whole people, but for his own section of it. The rest are, in his view,
      strangers, enemies, or rather pirates. The strongest aversion which he can
      feel to any foreign power is the ardour of friendship, when compared with
      the loathing which he entertains towards those domestic foes with whom he
      is cooped up in a narrow space, with whom he lives in a constant
      interchange of petty injuries and insults, and from whom, in the day of
      their success, he has to expect severities far beyond any that a conqueror
      from a distant country would inflict. Thus, in Greece, it was a point of
      honour for a man to cleave to his party against his country. No
      aristocratical citizen of Samos or Corcyra would have hesitated to call in
      the aid of Lacedæmon. The multitude, on the contrary, looked every where
      to Athens. In the Italian states of the thirteenth and fourteenth
      centuries, from the same cause, no man was so much a Pisan or a Florentine
      as a Ghibeline or a Guelf. It may be doubted whether <span class="pagenum">524</span><a
      name="link524" id="link524"></a>there was a single individual who would
      have scrupled to raise his party from a state of depression, by opening
      the gates of his native city to a French or an Arragonese force. The
      Reformation, dividing; almost every European country into&rsquo; two parts,
      produced similar effects. The Catholic was too strong for the Englishman,
      the Huguenot for the Frenchman. The Protestant statesmen of Scotland and
      France called in the aid of Elizabeth; and the Papists of the League
      brought a Spanish army into the very heart of France. &lsquo;The commotions to
      which the French Revolution gave rise were followed by the same
      consequences. The Republicans in every part of Europe were eager to see
      the armies of the National Convention and the Directory appear among them,
      and exulted in defeats which distressed and humbled those whom they
      considered as their worst enemies, their own rulers. The princes and
      nobles of France, on the other hand, did their utmost to bring foreign
      invaders to Paris. A very short time has elapsed since the Apostolical
      party in Spain invoked, too successfully, the support of strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great contest which raged in England during the seventeenth century
      extinguished, not indeed in the body of the people, but in those classes
      which were most actively engaged in politics, almost all national
      feelings. Charles the Second and many of his courtiers had passed a large
      part of their lives in banishment, living on the bounty of foreign
      treasuries, soliciting foreign aid to reestablish monarchy in their native
      country. The King&rsquo;s own brother had fought in Flanders, under the banners
      of Spain, against the English armies. The oppressed Cavaliers in England
      constantly looked to the Louvre and the Escurial for <span class="pagenum">525</span><a
      name="link525" id="link525"></a>deliverance and revenge. Clarendon
      censures the continental governments with great bitterness for not
      interfering in our internal dissensions. It is not strange, therefore,
      that, amidst the furious contests which followed the Restoration, the
      violence of party feeling should produce effects which would probably have
      attended it even in an age less distinguished by laxity of principle and
      indelicacy of sentiment. It was not till a natural death had terminated
      the paralytic old age of the Jacobite party that the evil was completely
      at an end. The Whigs long looked to Holland, the High Tories to France.
      The former concluded the Barrier Treaty; the latter entreated the Court of
      Versailles to send an expedition to England. Many men who, however
      erroneous their political notions might be, were unquestionably honourable
      in private life, accepted money without scruple from the foreign powers
      favourable to the Pretender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was there less of national feeling among the higher orders than
      during the reign of Charles the Second. That Prince, on the one side,
      thought it better to be the deputy of an absolute king than the King of a
      free people. Algernon Sydney, on the other hand, would gladly have aided
      France in all her ambitious schemes, and have seen England reduced to the
      condition of a province, in the wild hope that a foreign despot would
      assist him to establish his darling republic. The King took the money of
      France to assist him in the enterprise which he meditated against the
      liberty of his subjects, with as little scruple as Frederic of Prussia or
      Alexander of Russia accepted our subsidies in time of war. The leaders of
      the Opposition no more thought themselves disgraced by the presents of
      Lewis, than a gentleman of our own time <span class="pagenum">526</span><a
      name="link526" id="link526"></a>thinks himself disgraced by the liberality
      of powerful and wealthy members of his party who pay his election bill.
      The money which the King received from France had been largely employed to
      corrupt members of Parliament. The enemies of the court might think it
      fair, or even absolutely necessary, to encounter bribery with bribery.
      Thus they took the French gratuities, the needy among them for their own
      use, the rich probably for the general purposes of the party, without any
      scruple. If we compare their conduct not with that of English statesmen in
      our own time, but with that of persons in those foreign countries which
      are now situated as England then was, we shall probably see reason to
      abate something of the severity of censure with which it has been the
      fashion to visit those proceedings. Yet, when every allowance is made, the
      transaction is sufficiently offensive. It is satisfactory to find that
      Lord Russell stands free from any imputation of personal participation in
      the spoil. An age so miserably poor in all the moral qualities which
      render public characters respectable can ill spare the credit which it
      derives from a man, not indeed conspicuous for talents or knowledge, but
      honest even in his errors, respectable in every relation of life,
      rationally pious, steadily and placidly brave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great improvement which took place in our breed of public men is
      principally to be ascribed to the Revolution. Yet that memorable event, in
      a great measure, took its character from the very vices which it was the
      means of reforming. It was assuredly a happy revolution, and a useful
      revolution; but it was not, what it has often been called, a glorious
      revolution. William, and William alone, derived glory from it. <span
      class="pagenum">527</span><a name="link527" id="link527"></a>The
      transaction was, in almost every part, discreditable to England. That a
      tyrant who had violated the fundamental laws of the country, who had
      attacked the rights of its greatest corporations, who had begun to
      persecute the established religion of the state, who had never respected
      the law either in his superstition or in his revenge, could not be pulled
      down without the aid of a foreign army, is a circumstance not very
      grateful to our national pride. Yet this is the least degrading part of
      the story. The shameless insincerity of the great and noble, the warm
      assurances of general support which James received, down to the moment of
      general desertion, indicate a meanness of spirit and a looseness of
      morality most disgraceful to the age. That the enterprise succeeded, at
      least that it succeeded without bloodshed or commotion, was principally
      owing to an act of ungrateful perfidy, such as no soldier had ever before
      committed, and to those monstrous fictions respecting the birth of the
      Prince of Wales which persons of the highest rank were not ashamed to
      circulate. In all the proceedings of the Convention, in the conference
      particularly, we see that littleness of mind which is the chief
      characteristic of the times. The resolutions on which the two Houses at
      last agreed were as bad as any resolutions for so excellent a purpose
      could be. Their feeble and contradictory language was evidently intended
      to save the credit of the Tories, who were ashamed to name what they were
      not ashamed to do. Through the whole transaction no commanding talents
      were displayed by any Englishman; no extraordinary risks were run; no
      sacrifices were made for the deliverance of the nation, except the
      sacrifice which Churchill made of honour, and Anne of natural affection.
      <span class="pagenum">528</span><a name="link528" id="link528"></a>It
      was in some sense fortunate, as we have already said, for the Church of
      England, that the Reformation in this country was effected by men who
      cared little about religion. And, in the same manner, it was fortunate for
      our civil government that the Revolution was in a great measure effected
      by men who cared little about their political principles. At such a
      crisis, splendid talents and strong passions might have done more harm
      than good. There was far greater reason to fear that too much would be
      attempted, and that violent movements would produce an equally violent
      reaction, than that too little would be done in the way of change. But
      narrowness of intellect and flexibility of principle, though they may be
      serviceable, can never be respectable.
    </p>
    <p>
      If in the Revolution itself there was little that can properly be called
      glorious, there was still less in the events which followed. In a church
      which had as one man declared the doctrine of resistance unchristian, only
      four hundred persons refused to take the oath of allegiance to a
      government founded on resistance. In the preceding generation, both the
      Episcopal and the Presbyterian clergy, rather than concede points of
      conscience not more important, had resigned their livings by thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The churchmen, at the time of the Revolution, justified their conduct by
      all those profligate sophisms which are called Jesuitical, and which are
      commonly reckoned among the peculiar sins of Popery, but which in fact are
      every where the anodynes employed by minds rather subtle than strong, to
      quiet those internal twinges which they cannot but feel and which they
      will not obey. As the oath taken by the clergy was in the teeth of their
      principles, so was their conduct <span class="pagenum">529</span><a
      name="link529" id="link529"></a>in the teeth of their oath. Their constant
      machinations against the Government to which they had sworn fidelity
      brought a reproach on their order and on Christianity itself. A
      distinguished prelate has not scrupled to say that the rapid increase of
      infidelity at that time was principally produced by the disgust which the
      faithless conduct of his brethren excited in men not sufficiently candid
      or judicious to discern the beauties of the system amidst the vices of its
      ministers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the reproach was not confined to the Church. In every political party,
      in the Cabinet itself, duplicity and perfidy abounded. The very men whom
      William loaded with benefits and in whom he reposed most confidence, with
      his seals of office in their hands, kept up a correspondence with the
      exiled family. Orford, Leeds, and Shrewsbury were guilty of this odious
      treachery. Even Devonshire is not altogether free from suspicion. It may
      well be conceived that, at such a time, such a nature as that of
      Marlborough would riot in the very luxury of baseness. His former treason,
      thoroughly furnished with all that makes infamy exquisite, placed him
      under the disadvantage which attends every artist from the time that he
      produces a masterpiece. Yet his second great stroke may excite wonder,
      even in those who appreciate all the merit of the first. Lest his admirers
      should be able to say that at the time of the Revolution he had betrayed
      his King from any other than selfish motives, he proceeded to betray his
      country. He sent intelligence to the French court of a secret expedition
      intended to attack Brest. The consequence was that the expedition failed,
      and that eight hundred British soldiers lost their lives from the
      abandoned villany of a British general. Yet this man has been canonized by
      so many eminent writers that <span class="pagenum">530</span><a
      name="link530" id="link530"></a>to speak of him as he deserves may seem
      scarcely decent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reign of William the Third, as Mr. Hallam happily says, was the Nadir
      of the national prosperity. It was also the Nadir of the national
      character. It was the time when the rank harvest of vices sown during
      thirty years of licentiousness and confusion was gathered in; but it was
      also the seed-time of great virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The press was emancipated from the censorship soon after the Revolution;
      and the Government immediately fell under the censorship of the press.
      Statesmen had a scrutiny to endure which was every day becoming more and
      more severe. The extreme violence of opinions abated. The Whigs learned
      moderation in office; the Tories learned the principles of liberty in
      opposition. The parties almost constantly approximated, often met,
      sometimes crossed each other. There were occasional bursts of violence;
      but, from the time of the Revolution, those bursts were constantly
      becoming less and less terrible. The severity with which the Tories, at
      the close of the reign of Anne, treated some of those who had directed
      public affairs during the war of the Grand Alliance, and the retaliatory
      measures of the Whigs, after the accession of the House of Hanover, cannot
      be justified; but they were by no means in the style of the infuriated
      parties, whose alternate murders had disgraced our history towards the
      close of the reign of Charles the Second. At the fall of Walpole far
      greater moderation was displayed. And from that time it has been the
      practice, a practice not strictly according to the theory of our
      Constitution, but still most salutary, to consider the loss of office, and
      the public disapprobation, as punishments sufficient for errors in the
      administration not imputable to personal <span class="pagenum">531</span><a
      name="link531" id="link531"></a>corruption. Nothing, we believe, has
      contributed more than this lenity to raise the character of public men.
      Ambition is of itself a game sufficiently hazardous and sufficiently deep
      to inflame the passions without adding property, life, and liberty to the
      stake. Where the play runs so desperately high as in the seventeenth
      century, honour is at an end. Statesmen, instead of being as they should
      be, at once mild and steady, are at once ferocious and inconsistent. The
      axe is for ever before their eyes. A popular outcry sometimes unnerves
      them, and sometimes makes them desperate; it drives them to unworthy
      compliances, or to measures of vengeance as cruel as those which they have
      reason to expect. A Minister in our times need not fear either to be firm
      or to be merciful. Our old policy in this respect was as absurd as that of
      the king in the Eastern tale who proclaimed that any physician who pleased
      might come to court and prescribe for his diseases, but that if the
      remedies failed the adventurer should lose his head. It is easy to
      conceive how many able men would refuse to undertake the cure on such
      conditions; how much the sense of extreme danger would confuse the
      perceptions, and cloud the intellect, of the practitioner, at the very
      crisis which most called for self-possession, and how strong his
      temptation would be, if he found that he had committed a blunder, to
      escape the consequences of it by poisoning his patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in fact it would have been impossible, since the Revolution, to punish
      any Minister for the general course of his policy, with the slightest
      semblance of justice; for since that time no Minister has been able to
      pursue any general course of policy without the approbation of the
      Parliament. The most important effects of that great change were, as Mr.
      Hallam has <span class="pagenum">532</span><a name="link532"
       id="link532"></a>most truly said and most ably shown, those which it
      indirectly produced. Thenceforward it became the interest of the executive
      government to protect those very doctrines which an executive government
      is in general inclined to persecute. The sovereign, the ministers, the
      courtiers, at last even the universities and the clergy, were changed into
      advocates of the right of resistance. In the theory of the Whigs, in the
      situation of the Tories, in the common interest of all public men, the
      Parliamentary constitution of the country found perfect security. The
      power of the House of Commons, in particular, has been steadily on the
      increase. Since supplies have been granted for short terms and
      appropriated to particular services, the approbation of that House has
      been as necessary in practice to the executive administration as it has
      al-ways been in theory to taxes and to laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hallam appears to have begun with the reign of Henry the Seventh, as
      the period at which what is called modern history, in contradistinction to
      the history of the middle ages, is generally supposed to commence. He has
      stopped at the accession of George the Third, &ldquo;from unwillingness,&rdquo; as he
      says, &ldquo;to excite the prejudices of modern politics, especially those
      connected with personal character.&rdquo; These two eras, we think, deserved the
      distinction on other grounds. Our remote posterity, when looking back on
      our history in that comprehensive manner in which remote posterity alone
      can, without much danger of error, look back on it, will probably observe
      those points with peculiar interest. They are, if we mistake not, the
      beginning and the end of an entire and separate chapter in our annals. The
      period which lies between them is a perfect cycle, a great year of the
      public mind. <span class="pagenum">533</span><a name="link533"
       id="link533"></a>In the reign of Henry the Seventh, all the political
      differences which had agitated England since the Norman conquest seemed to
      be set at rest. The long and fierce struggle between the Crown and the
      Barons had terminated. The grievances which had produced the rebellions of
      Tyler and Cade had disappeared. Vilanage was scarcely known. The two royal
      houses, whose conflicting claims had long convulsed the kingdom, were at
      length united. The claimants whose pretensions, just or unjust, had
      disturbed the new settlement, were overthrown. In religion there was no
      open dissent, and probably very little secret heresy. The old subjects of
      contention, in short, had vanished; those which were to succeed had not
      yet appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon, however, new principles were announced; principles which were
      destined to keep England during two centuries and a half in a state of
      commotion. The Reformation divided the people into two great parties. The
      Protestants were victorious. They again subdivided themselves. Political
      factions were engrafted on theological sects. The mutual animosities of
      the two parties gradually emerged into the light of public life. First
      came conflicts in Parliament; then civil war; then revolutions upon
      revolutions, each attended by its appurtenance of proscriptions, and
      persecutions, and tests; each followed by severe measures on the part of
      the conquerors; each exciting a deadly and festering hatred in the
      conquered. During the reign of George the Second, things were evidently
      tending to repose. At the close of that reign, the nation had completed
      the great revolution which commenced in the early part of the sixteenth
      century, and was again at rest. The fury of sects had died away. The
      Catholics themselves practically enjoyed toleration; and more <span
      class="pagenum">534</span><a name="link534" id="link534"></a>than
      toleration they did not yet venture even to desire. Jacobitism was a mere
      name. Nobody was left to fight for that wretched cause, and very few to
      drink for it. The Constitution, purchased so dearly, was on every side
      extolled and worshipped. Even those distinctions of party which must
      almost always be found in a free state could scarcely be traced. The two
      great bodies which, from the time of the Revolution, had been gradually
      tending to approximation, were now united in emulous support of that
      splendid Administration which smote to the dust both the branches of the
      House of Bourbon. The great battle for our ecclesiastical and civil polity
      had been fought and won. The wounds had been healed. The victors and the
      vanquished were rejoicing together. Every person acquainted with the
      political writers of the last generation will recollect the terms in which
      they generally speak of that time. It was a glimpse of a golden age of
      union and glory, a short interval of rest, which had been preceded by
      centuries of agitation, and which centuries of agitation were destined to
      follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      How soon faction again began to ferment is well known. In the Letters of
      Junius, in Burke&rsquo;s Thoughts on the Cause of the Discontents, and in many
      other writings of less merit, the violent dissensions which speedily
      convulsed the country are imputed to the system of favouritism which
      George the Third introduced, to the influence of Bute, or to the
      profligacy of those who called themselves the King&rsquo;s friends. With all
      deference to the eminent writers to whom we have referred, we may venture
      to say that they lived too near the events of which they treated to judge
      correctly. The schism which was then appearing in the nation, and which
      has been from that time almost constantly <span class="pagenum">535</span><a
      name="link535" id="link535"></a>widening, had little in common with those
      schisms which had divided it during the reigns of the Tudors and the
      Stuarts. The symptoms of popular feeling, indeed, will always be in a
      great measure the same; but the principle which excited that feeling was
      here new. The support which was given to Wilkes, the clamour for reform
      during the American war, the disaffected conduct of large classes of
      people at the time of the French Revolution, no more resembled the
      opposition which had been offered to the government of Charles the Second,
      than that opposition resembled the contest between the Roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the political as in the natural body, a sensation is often referred to
      a part widely different from that in which it really resides. A man whose
      leg is cut off fancies that he feels a pain in his toe. And in the same
      manner the people, in the earlier part of the late reign, sincerely
      attributed their discontent to grievances which had been effectually
      lopped off. They imagined that the prerogative was too strong for the
      Constitution, that the principles of the Revolution were abandoned, that
      the system of the Stuarts was restored. Every impartial man must now
      acknowledge that these charges were groundless. The conduct of the
      Government with respect to the Middlesex election would have been
      contemplated with delight by the first generation of Whigs. They would
      have thought it a splendid triumph of the cause of liberty that the King
      and the Lords should resign to the lower House a portion of the
      legislative power, and allow it to incapacitate without their consent.
      This, indeed, Mr. Burke clearly perceived. &ldquo;When the House of Commons,&rdquo;
       says he, &ldquo;in an endeavour to obtain new advantages at the expense of the
      other orders of the <span class="pagenum">536</span><a name="link536"
       id="link536"></a>state, for the benefit of the commons at large, have
      pursued strong measures, if it were not just, it was at least natural,
      that the constituents should connive at all their proceedings; because we
      ourselves were ultimately to profit. But when this submission is urged to
      us in a contest between the representatives and ourselves, and where
      nothing can be put into their scale which is not taken from ours, they
      fancy us to be children when they tell us that they are our
      representatives, our own flesh and blood, and that all the stripes they
      give us are for our good.&rdquo; These sentences contain, in fact, the whole
      explanation of the mystery. The conflict of the seventeenth century was
      maintained by the Parliament against the Crown. The conflict which
      commenced in the middle of the eighteenth century, which still remains
      undecided, and in which our children and grandchildren will probably be
      called to act or to suffer, is between a large portion of the people on
      the one side, and the Crown and the Parliament united on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The privileges of the House of Commons, those privileges which, in 1642,
      all London rose in arms to defend, which the people considered as
      synonymous with their own liberties, and in comparison of which they took
      no account of the most precious and sacred principles of English
      jurisprudence, have now become nearly as odious as the rigours of martial
      law. That power of committing which the people anciently loved to see the
      House of Commons exercise, is now, at least when employed against
      libellers, the most unpopular power in the Constitution. If the Commons
      were to suffer the Lords to amend money-bills, we do not believe that the
      people would care one straw about the matter. If they were to suffer the
      Lords even to originate <span class="pagenum">537</span><a
      name="link537" id="link537"></a>money-bills, we doubt whether such a
      surrender of their constitutional rights would excite half so much
      dissatisfaction as the exclusion of strangers from a single important
      discussion. The gallery in which the reporters sit has become a fourth
      estate of the realm. The publication of the debates, a practice which
      seemed to the most liberal statesman of the old school full of danger to
      the great safeguards of public liberty, is now regarded by many persons as
      a safeguard tantamount, and more than tantamount, to all the rest
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke, in a speech on parliamentary reform which is the more remarkable
      because it was delivered long before the French Revolution, has described,
      in striking language, the change in public feeling of which we speak. &ldquo;It
      suggests melancholy reflections,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;in consequence of the strange
      course we have long held, that we are now no longer quarreling about the
      character, or about the conduct of men, or the tenour of measures; but we
      are grown out of humour with the English Constitution itself; this is
      become the object of the animosity of Englishmen. This constitution in
      former days used to be the envy of the world; it was the pattern for
      politicians; the theme of the eloquent; the meditation of the philosopher
      in every part of the world. As to Englishmen, it was their pride, their
      consolation. By it they lived, and for it they were ready to die. Its
      defects, if it had any, were partly covered by partiality, and partly
      borne by prudence. Now all its excellencies are forgot, its faults are
      forcibly dragged into day, exaggerated by every artifice of
      misrepresentation. It is despised and rejected of men; and every device
      and invention of ingenuity or idleness is set up in opposition, or in
      preference to it.&rdquo; We neither adopt nor condemn the <span class="pagenum">538</span><a
      name="link538" id="link538"></a>language of reprobation which the great
      orator here employs. We call him only as a witness to the fact. That the
      revolution of public feeling which he described was then in progress is
      indisputable; and it is equally indisputable, we think, that it is in
      progress still.
    </p>
    <p>
      To investigate and classify the causes of so great a change would require
      far more thought, and far more space, than we at present have to bestow.
      But some of them are obvious. During the contest which the Parliament
      carried on against the Stuarts, it had only to check and complain. It has
      since had to govern. As an attacking body, it could select its points of
      attack, and it naturally chose those on which it was likely to receive
      public support. As a ruling body, it has neither the same liberty of
      choice, nor the same motives to gratify the people. With the power of an
      executive government, it has drawn to itself some of the vices, and all
      the unpopularity of an executive government. On the House of Commons above
      all, possessed as it is of the public purse, and consequently of the
      public sword, the nation throws all the blame of an ill conducted war, of
      a blundering negotiation, of a disgraceful treaty, of an embarrassing
      commercial crisis. The delays of the Court of Chancery, the misconduct of
      a judge at Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land, any thing, in short, which in any part of
      the administration any person feels as a grievance, is attributed to the
      tyranny! or at least to the negligence, of that all-powerful body. Private
      individuals pester it with their wrongs and claims. A merchant appeals to
      it from the Courts of Rio Janeiro or St. Petersburgh. A historical painter
      complains to it that his department of art finds no encouragement.
      Anciently the Parliament resembled a <span class="pagenum">539</span><a
      name="link539" id="link539"></a>member of opposition, from whom no places
      are expected, who is not expected to confer favours and propose measures,
      but merely to watch and censure, and who may, therefore, unless he is
      grossly injudicious, be popular with the great body of the community. The
      Parliament now resembles the same person put into office, surrounded by
      petitioners whom twenty times his patronage would not satisfy, stunned
      with complaints, buried in memorials, compelled by the duties of his
      station to bring forward measures similar to those which he was formerly
      accustomed to observe and to check, and perpetually encountered by
      objections similar to those which it was formerly his business to raise.

      Perhaps it may be laid down as a general rule that a legislative assembly,
      not constituted on democratical principles, cannot be popular long after
      it ceases to be weak. Its zeal for what the people, rightly or wrongly,
      conceive to be their interests, its sympathy with their mutable and
      violent passions, are merely the effects of the particular circumstances
      in which it is placed. As long as it depends for existence on the public
      favour, it will employ all the means in its power to conciliate that
      favour. While this is the case, defects in its constitution are of little
      consequence. But, as the close union of such a body with the nation is the
      effect of an identity of interests not essential but accidental, it is in
      some measure dissolved from the time at which the danger which produced it
      ceases to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, before the Revolution, the question of Parliamentary reform was of
      very little importance. The friends of liberty had no very ardent wish for
      reform. The strongest Tories saw no objections to it. It is remarkable
      that Clarendon loudly applauds the changes which Cromwell introduced,
      changes far stronger than <span class="pagenum">540</span><a
      name="link540" id="link540"></a>the Whigs of the present day would in
      general approve. There is no reason to think, however, that the reform
      effected by Cromwell made any great difference in the conduct of the
      Parliament. Indeed, if the House of Commons had, during the reign of
      Charles the Second, been elected by universal suffrage, or if all the
      seats had been put up to sale, as in the French Parliaments, it would, we
      suspect, have acted very much as it did. We know how strongly the
      Parliament of Paris exerted itself in favour of the people on many
      important occasions; and the reason is evident. Though it did not emanate
      from the people, its whole consequence depended on the support of the
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time of the Revolution the House of Commons has been gradually
      becoming what it now is, a great council of state, containing many members
      chosen freely by the people, and many others anxious to acquire the favour
      of the people; but, on the whole, aristocratical in its temper and
      interest. It is very far from being an illiberal and stupid oligarchy; but
      it is equally far from being an express image of the general feeling. It
      is influenced by the opinion of the people, and influenced powerfully, but
      slowly and circuitously. Instead of outrunning the public mind; as before
      the Revolution it frequently did, it now follows with slow steps and at a
      wide distance. It is therefore necessarily unpopular; and the more so
      because the good which it produces is much less evident to common
      perception than the evil which it inflicts. It bears the blame of all the
      mischief which is done, or supposed to be done, by its authority or by its
      connivance. It does not get the credit, on the other hand, of having
      prevented those innumerable abuses which do not exist solely because the
      House of Commons exists. <span class="pagenum">541</span><a
      name="link541" id="link541"></a>A large part of the nation is certainly
      desirous of a reform in the representative system. How large that part may
      be, and how strong its desires on the subject may be, it is difficult to
      say. It is only at intervals that the clamour on the subject is loud and
      vehement. But it seems to us that, during the remissions, the feeling
      gathers strength, and that every successive burst is more violent than
      that which preceded it. The public attention may be for a time diverted to
      the Catholic claims or the Mercantile code; but it is probable that at no
      very distant period, perhaps in the lifetime of the present generation,
      all other questions will merge in that which is, in a certain degree,
      connected with them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already we seem to ourselves to perceive the signs of unquiet times, the
      vague presentiment of something great and strange which pervades the
      community, the restless and turbid hopes of those who have every thing to
      gain, the dimly hinted forebodings of those who have every thing to lose.
      Many indications might be mentioned, in themselves indeed as insignificant
      as straws; but even the direction of a straw, to borrow the illustration
      of Bacon, will show from what quarter the storm is setting in.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great statesman might, by judicious and timely reformations, by
      reconciling the two great branches of the natural aristocracy, the
      capitalists and the landowners, and by so widening the base of the
      government as to interest in its defence the whole of the middle class,
      that brave, honest, and sound-hearted class, which is as anxious for the
      maintenance of order and the security of property, as it is hostile to
      corruption and oppression, succeed in averting a struggle to which no
      rational friend of liberty or of law can look forward without <span
      class="pagenum">542</span><a name="link542" id="link542"></a>great
      apprehensions. There are those who will be contented with nothing but
      demolition; and there are those who shrink from all repair. There are
      innovators who long for a President and a National Convention; and there
      are bigots who, while cities larger and richer than the capitals of many
      great kingdoms are calling out for representatives to watch over their
      interests, select some hackneyed jobber in boroughs, some peer of the
      narrowest and smallest mind, as the fittest depositary of a forfeited
      franchise. Between these extremes there lies a more excellent way. Time is
      bringing round another crisis analogous to that which occurred in the
      seventeenth century. We stand in a situation similar to that in which our
      ancestors stood under the reign of James the First. It will soon again be
      necessary to reform that we may preserve, to save the fundamental
      principles of the Constitution by alterations in the subordinate parts. It
      will then be possible, as it was possible two hundred years ago, to
      protect vested rights, to secure every useful institution, every
      institution endeared by antiquity and noble associations, and, at the same
      time, to introduce into the system improvements harmonizing with the
      original plan. It remains to be seen whether two hundred years have made
      us wiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know of no great revolution which might not have been prevented by
      compromise early and graciously made. Firmness is a great virtue in public
      affairs; but it has its proper sphere. Conspiracies and insurrections in
      which small minorities are engaged, the outbreakings of popular violence
      unconnected with any extensive project or any durable principle, are best
      repressed by vigour and decision. To shrink from them is to make them
      formidable. But no wise ruler will <span class="pagenum">543</span><a
      name="link543" id="link543"></a>confound the pervading taint with the
      slight local irritation. No wise ruler will treat the deeply seated
      discontents of a great party, as he treats the fury of a mob which
      destroys mills and power-looms. The neglect of this distinction has been
      fatal even to governments strong in the power of the sword. The present
      time is indeed a time of peace and order. But it is at such a time that
      fools are most thoughtless and wise men most thoughtful. That the
      discontents which have agitated the country during the late and the
      present reign, and which, though not always noisy, are never wholly
      dormant, will again break forth with aggravated symptoms, is almost as
      certain as that the tides and seasons will follow their appointed course.
      But in all movements of the human mind which tend to great revolutions
      there is a crisis at which moderate concession may amend, conciliate, and
      preserve. Happy will it be for England if, at that crisis, her interests
      be confided to men for whom history has not recorded the long series of
      human crimes and follies in vain.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
